NVDA - Saw Jensen’s Commencement Speech and very impressed,2023-05-29
"Nvidia almost died 3 times in its 30-year history.

CEO Jensen Huang shared these near-death stories at a commencement speech last night.

Here's what he said:

LESSON 1: Have the humility to confront failure and ask for help

Nvidia's first big 3D chip contract was for Sega's new game console. 

From Jensen:

""After one year of development, we realized our architecture was the wrong strategy...

I contacted the CEO of Sega and suggested that they should find another partner. But I also needed Sega to pay us in full or Nivida would be out of business. 

I was embarrassed to ask. The CEO of Sega, to his credit and to my amazement, agreed. His understanding and generosity gave us six months to survive.

Confronting our mistake, and with humility, asking for help, saved Nvidia. These traits are the hardest for the brightest and most successful.""

LESSON 2: Endure the pain and suffering needed to realize your dream

In 2007, Nvidia announced CUDA, a new computing model for GPUs. 

From Jensen:

""Creating a new computing model is incredibly hard...Nvidia's profits took a significant hit...

We suffered many years of poor performance. 

Our shareholders were skeptical of CUDA and preferred we focused on improving profitability. But we persevered...

This journey forged our character to endure the pain and suffering that is always needed to realize a vision.""

LESSON 3: Make sacrifices for your life's work

In 2010, Nvidia had the lead in the mobile chip market. But then the competition came in.

From Jensen:

""The phone market is huge; we could have chosen to fight for share. Instead, we made a hard decision and sacrificed the market...

Nvidia's mission is to build computers to solve problems that ordinary computers cannot. 

We should dedicate ourselves to realizing our vision...

Our strategic retreat paid off. By leaving the phone market, we opened our minds to invent a new one.

To retreat from a giant phone market to create a $0 billion market was a risky move, but it paid off. 

Retreat does not come easily to the brightest people, yet strategic retreat, sacrifice, and deciding what to give up is at the very core of success.""

//

Jensen wrapped up the speech with this:

""Run don't walk. Either you're running for food, or you are running from being food:

1. Have the humility to confront failure and ask for help.
2. Endure the pain needed to realize your dream.
3. Make sacrifices for your life's work.""




Damn, this give speech gives me Steve Jobs vibes. I am even more impressed with Nvidia’s leadership now as a shareholder.",2023-05-29

NVDA Technical Breakdown Q2 2023,2023-05-29

Investing in the stock market involves a significant risk of loss, including the risk of loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results. You should conduct your own research and consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.**

**Disclosure: At the time of this publication, I, the author, personally hold a position in $NVDA. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions.**

&#x200B;

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), a leading chipmaker and AI company is on a tear recently, with its stock price hitting $389.46 on May 26, 2023 - a nearly 30% jump since the last earnings report. Contrastingly, the broader economic, geopolitical, and social environment send signals of uncertainty. The market's volatility index (VIX), which currently rests at a relatively low level of 17.95 hints at an imminent  downturn, indicating complacency among investors. However, it's important to remember that markets are complex and frequently behave contrary to expectations.

While the broader market seems calm, one sector, in particular, is leading the trend: the technology sector with chipmakers and AI companies are seeing a significant uptick.

**The big question is, should we dive in or wait it out?**

Before we get into that, let's be clear, this analysis is not financial advice. It's meant to shed some light that help us make better-informed decisions.

Let's get into it!

Nvidia's fundamentals are robust, but that's not our focus today. With the company venturing into high-growth territory and emotional responses overpowering rational data, we're turning our attention to technical analysis for potential insight into future movements.

To begin, we can see the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for NVDA is at 83.62, suggesting an overbought condition, which is typically considered when the RSI is above 70. This high RSI value might imply that the stock is due for a short-term pullback, as observed in NVDA's historical performance.

In the past, NVDA's RSI crossed the extreme overbought line of 80 five times: on Feb. 19, 2020, Sept. 2, 2020, July 6, 2021, and Nov. 8, 2021. Each time this occurred, there was a short-term pullback in the stock price ranging from 5.0% to 38.9% over periods from three sessions to a month. However, in each case, the stock reached a new record high within three months of the pullback.

Previously, a pattern referred to as bearish technical divergence was observed, which suggests that rallies are taking more and more out of the bulls, leaving them vulnerable to bear attacks. This pattern emerged in Nov. 2021 when the stock kept rising to a record $333.76 on Nov. 29, 2021, while the RSI was actually trending lower to a sub-overbought reading of 69.53 that day. This was followed by a significant 11-month bear market, where the price plunged 66.4% before bottoming at $112.27 on Oct. 14, 2022.

NVDA's price is currently close to the Fibonacci resistance level of $394.8. If it breaks this resistance, the next key level to watch would be $483.48. On the other hand, if the price declines, the Fibonacci levels of $364.09, $360.93, and $339.98 could provide support.

Fibonacci extension is another technical tool to identify possible resistance.The most common Fibonacci extension levels are 1.618, 2.618, and 4.236.

Let's calculate the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level for NVDA:

1. Subtract the low from the high to get the difference: 394.80 - 108.13 = 286.67
2. Multiply the difference by the Fibonacci ratio: 286.67 \* 1.618 = 464.02
3. Add the result to the low price: 108.13 + 464.02 = 572.15

However, please note that these levels are theoretical and while they can often serve as areas of support or resistance, they're not guaranteed to hold.

In summary, NVDA has been experiencing a strong upward trend across all these periods. This is accompanied by high trading volumes, suggesting robust investor interest. Given the strength of this upward trend and high trading volumes, it could be surmised that the market sentiment towards NVDA is bullish.

During the past 13 years, the highest PE Ratio of NVIDIA was 224.98. The lowest was 13.68. And the median was 39.94

&#x200B;

**So, where do we stand?**

Nvidia's underlying fundamentals are strong, yet the recent trading frenzy seems to eclipse these fundamental values. As emotions run high, we're observing price action that is increasingly detached from the stock's intrinsic worth. Anticipate considerable volatility in the coming month, which may lead to substantial capital losses for those choose to trade this stock even though overall sentiment is bullish. That being said, our enthusiasm for NVDA and AI at large is unwavering. We're extremely bullish, and we foresee plenty of upside potential. Despite this, due caution is warranted. Here are our projections and perspectives for the ensuing month:

&#x200B;

**Bear Scenario:**

While we've discussed the bull case for NVDA, it's equally important to consider the potential downside risks. If we look at the Fibonacci retracement levels, $364 emerges as the first potential support level that could hold during this breakout rally. Moreover, during a bull run, the 5-day moving average often provides a level of support while 10-day MA could signal possible weakness, so it's essential to keep an eye on this as well.

One notable aspect of NVDA's recent price action is the significant gap up. This has created a large area that could be 'filled' if the stock were to pull back, which is a common pattern in technical analysis. As such, we could see NVDA potentially retracing to the $320 level, which, given the gap-fill scenario, could serve as a very strong support level.

These are all potential scenarios that could play out in the near term. It's important to monitor these levels and adjust our investment strategies accordingly, always being mindful of both potential upside and downside risks.

&#x200B;

**Bull Scenario:**

On the more optimistic, or bullish, side of the spectrum, we draw upon Tesla's impressive P/E ratio of over 1,000 during its significant rally two years ago. If NVDA were to reach a similar P/E ratio, this would translate to a stock price of $2190. However, considering NVDA's near trillion-dollar market capitalization and current growth rates, reaching such a level would be extremely ambitious. At this stock price, NVDA would have a market cap of an astonishing $5 trillion.

For perspective, Apple, currently the world's most valuable company, has a market cap of $2.7 trillion. If NVDA were to reach the same market cap as Apple, this would equate to a stock price of $1095. However, the market often anticipates such significant milestones and investors may start selling before reaching this psychological barrier.

As NVDA begins to show signs of a meme stock momentum, it’s essential to draw upon historical precedents from similar market movements. Notably, Dogecoin experienced a sharp downturn after it nearly reached the much-anticipated $1 target, peaking at $0.74. AMC's stock price exhibited a similar pattern, retreating after it hit $72. There appears to be a consistent trend of investors taking profits when the price hits approximately 3/4 of a clear target. Given this, if we set a bullish target for NVDA at $1,000, we can anticipate a potential price ceiling in the vicinity of $720, where significant resistance may be encountered. For those seeking to mitigate risk, considering an exit at around $680 could be a prudent strategy. This price corresponds to a market capitalization of $1.68 trillion and a P/E ratio of 355.5. While this is an ambitious target, it's not beyond the realms of possibility given the current rally.

&#x200B;

**Realistic Scenario:**

Based on our analysis of Fibonacci Retracement levels and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio trends, we consider NVDA reaching $480 as the most probable outcome. This represents a potential 23% increase from the current price level. In this scenario, NVDA would have a P/E ratio of 251.31, indicating a market capitalization of approximately $1.18 trillion. This could be an opportune moment to sell, locking in gains before any potential market correction.

While it's also interesting to note that at a P/E ratio of 300, while high, is not unheard of for high-growth tech stocks. This would place NVDA's market cap at around $1.4 trillion and the stock price at approximately $573, which is in line with Fibonacci extension. Given NVDA's strong fundamentals and growth prospects, we believe this could be the upper bounds of realistic outcome.

In conclusion, while trading high volatility stocks with meme stock momentum can be very risky, and has no fundamental backing at this point. It comes down to emotional control and resilience. We believe that a thorough understanding of NVDA's technical and fundamental indicators can guide investment decisions. Please keep in mind that investing involves risk and it is important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

&#x200B;

It's crucial to remain cool-headed and resilient. Knowledge is power, so understand the technical and fundamental indicators to guide your investment decisions. Remember, trading involves risk - don't go all-in without doing your homework and consulting with a professional advisor. Happy trading!",2023-05-29

NVDA did not file a new shelf offering.,2023-05-28
"No open positions in NVDA, but follow it. I’m seeing a misunderstanding run wild and thought I’d make a post to address it: NVIDIA on Friday did not file for NEW shelf offering. They filed an amendment to the one from February (the difference being dilution of 20 billion vs 10 billion). Further, the quarterly report explicitly addressed that this filing was coming purely for administrative purposes and that they actually have no plans to use it anytime soon (ie no dilution at all anytime soon).

The bear narrative that the rug has been pulled isn’t correct and everything can be understood by reading the quarterly report.

"If you ever feel bad, remember that Cathie Wood dumped NVDA in early January when it was in the $140s",2023-05-25
" (Bloomberg) -- **Cathie Wood’s flagship exchange-traded fund closed out  its Nvidia Corp. stake in early January**. Then, came the artificial  intelligence frenzy that sent the stock and its big tech peers on a  tear.

The chipmaker has added around $560 billion in market  capitalization since Wood dumped her shares — with the last $200 billion  of that surge coming overnight after the company handily beat earnings.

Although  Wood holds Nvidia across several of her smaller funds, investors in the  flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) have mostly been left out of  this year’s blistering 161.58% rally.

**In February, when Nvidia traded for $234 a share, roughly 50 times forward earnings, Wood said the valuation was “very high.”**

“We  like Nvidia, we think it’s going to be a good stock. It’s priced —it’s  the ‘check-the-box’ AI company,” Wood told CNBC on Feb 27. “For a  flagship fund, where we’ve consolidated towards our highest conviction  names, part of that has to do with valuation.”

A spokesperson for ARK Investment Management said the company doesn’t comment on trading activity. 

Wood has been a long-time fan of Nvidia, but her conviction on the stock has wavered at times.

PROFIT Update: NVDA YOLO will it pay off,2023-05-25
"Many of you were asking for me to post an update on my $NVDA weekly call option profits. Today I sold near open. Could've made about 20k more if timed it perfectly but I have no regrets, I am very happy!! 

I made around 181k (in USD) in profits, and this account went from 38k to around 219k (in USD)

I am now DCA into dividend stocks over the next few weeks, mixed in with some ""growth"" stocks mixed in that still pay a little dividend. Some of you were asking which dividend stocks I plan to buy, and this is not financial advice and DYOR but they include: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA (very small opening position at this price), JPM, SBUX, KO, PG, and O.

Of these, at today's (May 25, 2023) prices, my fav starting price positions are for SBUX and O (think these are good price for these 2 stocks especially). Again, not financial advice.

Happy to collect dividends from this portfolio going forward!

"NVDA may hold promise for the future, but its current Price to Earnings (PE) and Price to Sales (PS) ratios are less than impressive. Earnings appear stagnant, with PC gaming in decline. The majority of their profit is derived from data services, rather than Al.

Moreover, we're grappling with the debt ceiling limit. When analyzing patterns from past 'blood weeks', history shows NVDA experienced a 30% drop during such events. The economic outlook is not favorable and there's a downward trend, as evidenced by the overvaluation of PPD. Despite being hyped and exceeding $100 due to strong buying pressure for a significant period, it now faces a 40% reduction.

Add to that the ongoing uncertainty around the China trade war, and you have a multitude of reasons contributing to a potential decrease in the stock's value.

Disclosure: I hold over 17k short positions in NVDA. My investment track record is far from flawless - I lost approximately 80k last March and, to date, Fidelity has yet to retrieve my funds. So, my struggles in the market are evident. Let's proceed.",2023-05-24

This post is aging like fine whole milk.,2023-05-24
Trading volume was too low to sustain NVDA’s after hours price action.,2023-05-25
"

Listen folks, there was not enough trade volume to trust the current price of NVDA. It looks like there were a bunch of people buying, and no one selling and that pumped the price due to artificial scarcity. When the profit taking begins, the share price will fall rapidly. It will probably hold on to most of its gains as there will also be more buyers and not just more sellers in a higher volume environment.

If you won your NVDA, it will be a max dash to take your profits tomorrow morning. I suggest liquidating during pre market.

All y’all with huge unrealized gains on your options, hopefully you’re still ITM after pre market price action. Expect huge slippage when you’re selling your calls if you’re not deep ITM when options trading resumes. 


What happens after the pre market and opening sell off? FOMO dip buyers, scalpers, and passive funds rebalancing will help stem the losses to a degree. Or, the market will see a falling knife and steer clear.

Did y’all NVDA bulls get the chance to sell your calls today?,2023-05-26
"I have a question, I really didn’t see any huge Bid size on multiple brokerages for calls. Like some were 5-30 contracts. The bigger sizes were the closer to $300-$330 but even those weren’t heavily volumed. Was all of them closed at open like really quick. But I checked literally at open, no way thousands of contracts were all sold at open. 

Please someone explain cause I have seen stocks go up yet calls didn’t sell cause there was no bidding.",2023-05-26

Is it time to short NVDA?,2023-05-24
"NVDA has been a hot topic in WallstreetsBets for a long time. Seems like all the bears have been getting squeezed to absolute nothingness. After seeing it rally another 20% after earnings today one has to ask themselves, is it time to short the chip manufacturing giant NVDA. With a whopping 750B Market cap is it really worth the price we see on our brokerages. 
If you ask me I’d say maybe it’s time to take some profits and flip a little bit bearish but who am I?",2023-05-24

"TLDR: me no like dollar store. me short dollar store company. also ai is the future. 

Here are some more-likely-true-than-not assumptions:

1. AI is the future. because AI duh. 
2. Dollar stores are not the future (who buys 6 eggs for $3 when you can buy a dozen for the same price 🫠)
3. i don’t like dollar stores. 

who am i to say these assumptions are correct in the first place? 🙃 nonetheless based on these assumptions DLTR is more worthy of shorting than NVDA/AMD/AAPL etc etc.

"The daily abandoned baby… 5-24-23 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ and VIX Daily Market Analysis (bonus NVDA earnings)",2023-05-24
"Well going into today I actually found myself to be fairly bullish and I truly expected a bounce and for us to close much higher than we closed yesterday. However, that clearly did not happen and clearly was wrong to be a bull up here. 

Looking at SPY and QQQ daily here it would appear that I was a day early… With SPY and QQQ closing out there abandoned baby daily bullish reversal candles honestly the temptation to swing calls is insanely high… However, I actually back tested my swing trades dating back to early 2022 and I actually am net negative on swings alone… so as much as they are enticing… not worth it to me. 

Now for those of you that don’t know what the abandoned baby pattern is… it’s a rarity and doesn’t always play out but when it does it usually results in a pretty massive move up… May 4th is the best example of that daily pattern.

There is literally nothing else that I can describe this market right now then “WOW.” I Just can not imagine the fact that a company with a PE near 200 can rally almost 27% on earnings and be near the ATHs… that truly is mindboggling. 

This market reminds me a lot of the spring of 2021… 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmxx7f3j1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d3d5cef6baa1526e4ff58e48976169e2ee9afe3

Now from a supply and demand stand point we didn’t do anything different today. The most intriguing thing is the fact that we actually gapped under the 413.05 supply. So generally speaking to have a previous supply taken out you must close a new supply over it and then you must touch that level with price action… a gap down completely changes that metric. So for now that 413.05 level remains on the books. 

We did come down and test 410.2 demand (Support) and hold that nicely today. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema for the first time since May 4th. 

Honestly, I can no help but notice the similarities of todays candle to May 4ths daily candle. If that is the case we likely could see a green open tomorrow and green day tomorrow. This would give us an opportunity to turn 411.16 into a new higher demand. 

However, IF bears can continue this momentum lower then more likely than not our target is daily demand (support) at 404.32/ 405.12. The daily DMI has officially reset to over sold but has not started its wave up. So we are in the early stages of finding the next bottom…. However, keep in mind that the DMI can remain oversold for a period of time before it retraces. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j6yl9mjj1v1b1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=853a6d1a3e9b1c57946198621ba7d12481cc656e

On the Daily we clearly broke through support of the red and black rising wedge. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema. However, we once again are finding support at the daily 50ema. 

We will keep an eye on this blue bear channel with resistance at 415.2 for tomorrow. In all honestly it appears that I was just one day too early on the bull rally… with NVDA this very well is the dip buy opportunity before we push hard to the 420-430 area again. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 413 -> 418.8  
 Demand- 410.2 -> 405.1  
 Support- 411.1 -> 410.2 -> 408.9  
 Resistance- 412.5 -> 414.1 -> 417.1

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j8i3gjzj1v1b1.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=85f45cb78bb1d821682107696293d75addffaa43

Futures came down and took out that 4149 supply that they had fell just short of yesterday. With this log wicked doji I do expect some upside tomorrow. However, the one interesting thing here is that right now this new daily candle has still not tried to put a new demand (support) in… DMI remainds oversold though so favor would be a short term bounce coming soon. 

If we get a green day and green bounce on futures tomorrow with a closure over 4165 then we should try to turn 4145 into a new demand (Support). 

However, if we fall through 4127 demand tomorrow then our target would be 4075 demand. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/baah8wek1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2ad7f1bed271fc0ccc759cf47cd131db00f55f13

Same story here on futes is that we did push a daily candle through the red and black daily rising wedge and now we find ourselves looking at this blue resistance line and that 4159 will be a major resistance to watch that futures actually is hard rejecting after hours here. 

If this is a back test and rejection of the daily 8ema on futures this could be a very bearish movement with the ultimate target being 4095 support. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4055 -> 4208  
 Demand- 4128 -> 4075  
 Support- 4125 -> 4110 -> 4095   
 Resistance- 4159 -> 4171 -> 4190 -> 4208

**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7e0td00l1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=beb3e112d1b7c7d461bb36df8a515ce6f4ce7c98

QQQ did close the same bullish abandoned baby pattern here as SPY… QQQ missed its intraday gap fill by about 9 cents. 

The daily 20ema will sit just over that 326.82 supply tomorrow and if the bears can continue to sell the markets off (which will be very hard to see QQQ drop with NVDA up 28%) then we should target that 326.82 supply. Looking here you can see we have a major demand (support) are at 325/326 and that should be a big area where we could bounce If we do see a continuation sell off. 

However, if we get a green day tomorrow we likely will see the DMI wave back up with a new demand being established at 331.32. This would lead QQQ to target 336.37 demand. I actually will look to take some longer 14-30dte calls on QQQ if we do see that play out tomorrow. 

QQQ Daily Levels  
 Supply- 337.6 -> 326.82 -> 322.31  
 Demand- 336.37 -> 325.99 -> 34.99

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vk3faoel1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9c668e1bcc92d6f4bedd9ecc35986f1df6a5c257

One reason I am also particularly bullish is the fact that the VIX attempted to break out over that critical 20.08 level and rejected. This rejection is a near perfect double top off the May 4th VIX candle which is when SPY put its bottom in… 

If the VIX retraces tomorrow and closes under 20.08 again then I would feel far more confident that we are going to see a bigger upside move on SPY…

The next major upside level for the VIX is 21.36 and downside level is 18.86.

Honestly this was a terrible trading day just from a day trading stand point… 0dte premiums were so juiced because of Yellen and FOMC minutes and we had really such little overall movement that plays just weren’t paying out very well… I really did okay trading intraday and my day trades were green by my swing calls were obviously red and that gave me a good sized hole. 

Still working on a nice week of gains here but definitely not my best day of trading.",2023-05-24
I read your posts every day and most the time your spot on man! I have an 82 percent win rate however I help 5 415 puts and 7 410 puts over night even tho you were bullish and I was to tbh something told me to only sell one of them. Today sold all of them for one of my best trading days. Turned around and bought 5 325 qqq calls and  7 415 spy calls and 2 350 nivida calls for Friday based on earnings could be a 10 bagger.

"I'm about to finish my second month of trading spy options and my first month of following here.  I am just barely green after two months with a couple of fantastic weeks and a disastrous start to May.  

My stake is between 1k and 1.5k

My weekly goals are between $300 and $500

I am generally making 2 trades per day.  

I have to say your write ups are very helpful.  I could use a bit of advice on finding entry and exit points, though.  I tend to be a bit behind on my entries and hold on a bit too long for exits.  I miss out on some movements and either lose gains or leave money on the table.  Any advice is appreciated

Thanks for all you do here",2023-05-25
"Cramer, NVDA and Algos",2023-05-25
"This are the tweets from Jim Cramer regarding NVDA today:

https://preview.redd.it/2zlog65kqx1b1.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e9b97454e3b5082742a8991da7ab0a5157f81e5a

The first one was made before the earnings data (1:38 PM PDT (California time)). NVDA earnings release was at 2:00 PM

In theory is a bullish tweet if you assume that he loves his dog. But algos (AI) may have interpreted it like ""NVDA is like a dog"" so it will ""underperform"".

Maybe that sparked a signal on the algos and they started to bid NVDA shares helping to drive it to ATHs (I bet advanced algos support the inverseCramer signal)

Some hours later Cramer started tweeting clearly unambiguous bullish tweets about NVDA. The thing is that he tweeted those after trading was closed. After hours trading ends at 8:00 PM ET (which is 5:00 PM PDT) and he did that tweet at 5:13 PM PDT

Wow! Will the Algos reverse and sell tomorrow?

It will be interesting to see what happens",2023-05-25

"Unleashing the Hybrid Cloud AI Revolution: Nvidia's DGX, IBM's Ansible, and the Perfect Storm",2023-05-30
"Not financial advice!

Nvidia's recent product announcements may provide valuable clues about the future of AI and which companies are best positioned for the value AI will unlock. I'm not personally interested in buying  NVDA at current prices, as its price seems to be close to at least somewhat re-rated to market expectations.  We're early in the game here de-gens and there might be other opportunities worth exploring that are flying under the radar.  It' this regard’s opinion that reading between the lines of Nvidia's new product roadmap, can uncover potential AI benefits that haven't yet been fully reflected in the stock prices of other companies.

So… Nvidia has dropped a big one with its new DGX AI platform. If you're into the tech scene, you know Nvidia is a man amongst boys in the AI space. This DGX thing? It's a beast. Imagine a supercharged AI playground, but it's not just playing around - it's working, and working damn hard.

It's gonna be huge for our cloud bros - Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Google Cloud, IBM, all of 'em. They'll be drooling all over this DGX platform. Why? It's like an AI power-up. Whoever taps into this beast will have their AI game leveled up big time.

But here's where the fun starts. This DGX tech isn't just good for any cloud - it's perfect for the hybrid cloud approach. That's where you mix up your on-premises servers (that's tech talk for the old-school, actual physical stuff) with public cloud services. This hybrid stuff is a big deal for AI because it gives you flexibility, security, and the raw horsepower you need to run high-powered AI applications. And guess who's the hybrid cloud champ? It's our old friend IBM, who's been pushing the hybrid cloud way harder than anyone else.

And how does IBM do it? Enter Ansible. This thing is like the magic wand for setting up and managing hybrid cloud stuff. It's a massive hit with the tech geeks because it's like a cheat code for making complex stuff simple. Ansible lets you stand up new hybrid cloud AI products and services like you're flipping pancakes.

Now, Ansible's part of IBM's tool kit, thanks to their acquisition of Red Hat a while back. IBM + Ansible + hybrid cloud is like the dream team for leveraging Nvidia's DGX platform. While all the cloud providers are gonna want a piece of the DGX pie, IBM is sitting pretty with their hybrid cloud focus and their Ansible magic.

Bottom line: Nvidia's DGX platform is throwing down the gauntlet in the AI game, and it's shouting ""hybrid cloud or bust!"" IBM's sitting in the sweet spot with Ansible and their hybrid cloud game.

IBM’s share value has been mostly stagnant over the past few months.  No AI respect!  No AI respect here at all I tell ya!  When the next year or two’s quarterly numbers come in, the markets will have to take notice.  JMO",2023-05-30

Use these like any indicator, with caution. Basically gives you an understanding of when we start going into oversold or overbought territories.

1. This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers.
2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves. Obviously, if there are unexpected poison pills in an earnings report or if there are unexpected positive catalysts, you can move outside the deviations.
3. it's expected that 70% of the time we fall within the range by the end of the week/month/quarter. So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair it together with another tool called RSI. Most people are familiar with RSI. If we break out of the upper expected moves on already high RSI, this can create favorable short setups where you do have probabilities on your side. Now keep in mind point 1 & 2 that I made. You can have overbought + high RSI on individual tickers like MSFT and NVDA because of something that may fundamentally change the company like a new revenue stream. Hence why this is more useful on index-related products.
4. At the end of the day, this is all a game of probability. When you are oversold on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the upside. When you are overbought on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the downside.",2023-05-30

Holy fuck bro. That average cost is the lowest I’ve seen on Reddit,2023-05-25
So what's your strategies for next week on debt ceiling and NVDA earnings?,2023-05-20
"I am going in with a bunch of baggy puts 30 320 QQQ (You can guess when I bought these LOL), 10 330 QQQ puts, and 20 410 SPY puts and 10 SPY call 5/26 425. I'm thinking markets will be volatile and hope that my puts will eventually print... But, most likely calls will do better. All spy positions are 26 and QQQ's are on 23rd.

For NVDA I was planning to open a call position closer to the day of earnings, because I suspect markets to be swinging back and forth. But, now I'm conflicted, cause I was just bored and looking at some news on CNBC for fun. And came upon this... So yea now Idk I actually kind of agree with Cramer and I know I should inverse myself/Cramer, but this AI hype train is just too FOMO/YOLO/STRONK energy .

Op has a point. TSMC make all of Nvidia's chips. No TSMC no Nvidia GPUs. They can change fabs ofc but it does put the valuation into perspective. Not many fabs can rival TSMCs process and that's a big part of what has been fueling the energy efficiency of the latest generations of GPUs.,2023-05-19

**QQQ will hit a new all time high before the end of 2023.**   
That's it. That's all you need, one giant picture and a stock recommendation. But if you want a little bit more here ya go.   


  


[Haha, dum bers](https://preview.redd.it/27oqvqb4e52b1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c5275a5ee98788e38d1598bdb7f1903be6e4155e)

 

You fucking monkeys don't know shit. You're all too scared of your god damned shadows because this world has eaten you up and spit you out. You got one fucking win on Shitadel two years ago and you've been mowed down trying to relive that glory. You all remind me of those fucking apes in 2001 too afraid to step forward and transcend by touching the monolith  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHWs3c3YNs4 . But this ape, /u/ShittyStockPicker ain't afraid to take a fucking risk. 

I’ve been hearing about the impending recession since covid started, I’ve been hearing about the collapse of the dollar since 1990. The internet is full of bears who want to see America punished for its imagined sins: greed, debt, laziness. Why, if you listened to those fucking bears who hate this country and want to see it fail you'd think America was two Oompa Loompas away from being sung a demeaning song about why it fucked up and dragged off the world stage.   
But I'm not one of those America haters. I'm like Warren Buffet, I never fucking bet against America. Ever. 

The hard pill for America haters to swallow is that we are the best god damned system on the planet bar none. The culture we have built worships talent and those stupid enough to risk everything for a dream.  And we don't give a flying fuck if you're a queer dragon-kintyped non-binary star planet. If you're stupid enough to try the impossible, we're going to fucking cheer you on. And when you achieve the impossible, we're going to fucking reward you with it by both worshiping you as a fucking god and more wealth than you know what to do with.   


It's not that way in any other system. You won't find that in Europe, you're not going to find it in India. Don't even think about trying to find that in China.   
If you have a fucking crazy, insane longshot idea that just might fucking work the only people stupid enough to try live here. And its because if you're not descended from people who were told by their countrymen, ""Hey, Gus, just shut the fuck up about going to the moon already and eat your fucking gruel."" You said, ""fuck it, I'm going to America and studying engineering until I can build the biggest ass ladder I can possibly build!""   
And that's still the America I believe in. And I believe that's the America /r/WallStreetBets believes in.   
So is it any fucking surprise then, that once again the United States is at the forefront of yet another technological revolution that is going to profoundly transform global society, rearrange international power structures, and change everything? 

I've been struggling to explain what AI means to people. But here's my best shot, dumb fucks probably want to skip to the end for the TLDR: ***The Information Technology boom introduced sharing of information at 0 marginal cost. The AI boom is different from the Information Technology boom because it is the beginning of the generation of new information at 0 marginal cost.***   
***Information Age: Sharing information at 0 marginal cost***  

***AI Age: Generation of new information at 0 marginal cost***  

Let that fucking sink in. *Generation of information at 0 marginal cost from newspapers to rocket designs.*  

I don't know if you had the chance to listen to the $NVDA conference call, but holy shit I fucking creamed myself rubbing my dick to it. There's nothing that gets me off harder than Capitalism Erotica. 

What the $NVDA call revealed is that corporate America is scrambling to build systems that utilize AI to keep their businesses competitive. There is no reluctance to adopt AI the same way there was reluctance to adopt IT technology 20 years ago. That's going to make adoption of AI happen fucking fast!

Many current CEO's remember companies going bust, or losing market share to a rival who was faster to adopt groundbreaking technology. *The lesson they learned was that it is deadly to shrug off changes in technology.*

The first wave of the AI boom is in stocks like $NVDA. Demand for their chips is going to be insane. The next wave, we'll see this show up in six to twelve months or so, is going to be the companies who adopted AI early and found obvious and unexpected ways to take advantage of 0 marginal cost information generation. ***The moment a company who adopted AI reports that an AI technology led to a blowout quarter we're going to see an explosion in stock prices and unimaginable GDP growth.*** 

We’re not going into recession, we’re on the brink of pushing the world into an unprecedented era of GDP growth and exponential growth in the rate of improvement of living standards.

We’re months away from new all time highs on the Nasdaq. The American economy is about to rip the world’s face off with a GDP rally the likes of which the world had never seen. 

TLDR: HAHAHAHAHA BERSSSSS R FUKKKKKKKK

Reports of my death were not greatly exaggerated. Lost over a million dollars at 22 years old.,2023-05-25
"&#x200B;

[Account #1. Ended up taking whatever remaining money out of this account to pay taxes and fund my other account](https://preview.redd.it/y4xuqby86x1b1.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c7c73189b0625770cb19a9a1b9e05f72908c2600)

[Account #3. Maxed out my credit card, line of credit, and took some money from account #1 to put here.](https://preview.redd.it/at30q8147x1b1.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=968f768cc4f72f9aeb0f846592914e2445b5aed9)

Almost all of my losses came from being \~max margin short $NVDA during earnings (last earnings, not this one), and being \~max margin long during $ASTS earnings.

I've coped with these losses decently well I would like to think. I'm still up a ton from where I started (\~70k), but it kind of sucks not being a millionaire anymore. I used to pay the bill every time my friends and I would go out to eat, tip big, get haircuts often, eat out every single meal of the day (and be able to afford extra meat lol), etc. I don't feel secure doing that right now. It felt really good not having to worry about money.

The worst out of all this is that I promised my parents I would buy them a house, and I can no longer do that. Houses are 1.5m+ in my area, and at one point I could have literally bought it in cash. Instead, I gambled it all away. They were dejected but I can't go back to the past and change what happened. They'll have to live in a shitty apartment unfortunately until I can figure things out again.  

Let's look at the bright side (coping mechanism😔):

1. I made these mistakes at 22. I still have time to recover from losses (hopefully)
2. I already took out and spent \~150k buying my parent's cars, paying off their debts, and spending money on myself before I lost most the money
3. I haven't lost everything. Almost everything, but not everything.
4. I couldn't sleep at night with my extremely leveraged portfolio. I feel as if a weight has been taken off my back.
5. I am still alive, and healthy. We don't need much money nowadays to get our basic needs met. We don't need much money to be happy.

At the end of the day, I'm still thankful for everything I've been blessed with. I have clean water, food on the table, and a roof over my head. Sure, you need to strive and work towards greater heights, but you still need to appreciate what you have.

Lessons/Mistakes:

1. We underestimate tail risks (even if you know that you underestimate tail risks), and we underestimate how losses (and wins) can trigger a feedback loop of possibly portfolio-ending decisions (I literally wrote this on my last post before I lost my money, but I ended up losing it anyways😓)
2. The market is not rational. It doesn't care about your squiggly (or straight) lines or your discounted cash flow analysis (at least right away). Position yourself accordingly.
3. Have other things to do other than watching the market. I was researching/watching the market 10 hours+ a day some days. I stopped going to the gym. I stopped going to my classes. Etc. Just to watch the market and find some sort of alpha online. Being too active made me consistently switch my positions up, and made me unable to sit on my hands.
4. Position sizing. I would go all in on a single stock a lot of the time. Using margin as well.
5. Using margin. I was using maximum margin ever since I started investing/trading. I'm surprised I didn't get wiped a whole lot earlier. When you use max margin, you are forced to sell at the worst prices, and volatility drag occurs.
6. Shorting on max margin. This was pretty fking regarded, but it's what made me most of my money. When you short, you can only make a maximum of 100% but your risks are unlimited. Not an asymmetrical bet you'd want to take often imo.
7. Next time around, if I do ""short"", I would need to either do it using puts or be short stock with calls as hedges.
8. All or nothing mentality. Even when I already made it. This was pretty regarded as well. I could have gone all in on dividend stocks and never had to work a day in my life. But I didn't do that.
9. Probs a million other things

Don't really have much more to say, but take care of yourselves bros. Start hitting the gym. Talk to that girl (even if she makes you nervous). Make more money. Fix/strengthen your relationship with your friends and family. Find God. Find yourself a waifu (not Mikasa because she's taken). You get the point.

How a Debt-Ceiling Crisis Could Screw Up Wall Street 📉,2023-05-26
"Here are what you regards should know about the current debt-ceiling situation. \[Source\]([https://www.wsj.com/articles/debt-ceiling-crisis-wall-street-acc4b5a7](https://www.wsj.com/articles/debt-ceiling-crisis-wall-street-acc4b5a7))   


💸 The US government is getting dangerously close to not being able to pay its damn bills on time, and that's bad news for Wall Street and the global financial system.

📉 If the US government defaults on its Treasury bonds, it could totally screw up the multi-trillion dollar markets that keep everything running smoothly.

💪 The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Sifma) has been busting its ass for over a decade, trying to come up with a plan to avoid a catastrophic blow to the financial markets like we saw back in 2011.

🤔 So, what's gonna happen if Congress doesn't raise the debt limit in time? Well, Sifma says the Treasury might have to delay repaying bondholders and screw with their interest payments. And that's gonna piss off a lot of investors.

🤷‍♂️ You've got money-market funds, banks, and companies all investing in Treasurys to manage their cash. Plus, tons of regular folks have been buying up government debt, especially short-term T-bills. But if a deal isn't reached, those poor suckers might not get their money back for who knows how long!

📅 Sifma expects the Treasury to take it day by day, announcing plans to extend the life of bonds that are supposed to mature on the day before. It's all about keeping the show going, you know?

💥 But here's the thing, if the Treasury messes up and a bond matures without getting paid, it's gonna cause chaos in the Fedwire system. That could freeze billions of dollars in assets overnight and seriously make people question if the US government has any credibility left.

🤯 This debt-ceiling mess could have all sorts of crazy consequences. It might trigger a full-blown financial crisis and who knows what else. The SEC chair is warning that those hedge fund guys have been borrowing like crazy in the Treasury market, and that's a risk to all of us regular folks.

⚠️ Remember back in 2011 when S&P downgraded the US credit rating? Well, analysts are worried that more downgrades could happen, and that would seriously shake confidence in the US government. Wall Street would feel the pain, and the government and taxpayers might end up paying more in interest.

💰 The US Treasury's cash on hand isn't looking too great. They've got an account at the Fed called the Treasury General Account, but it's almost $900 billion lighter than last year. Not a good sign.

📉 This debt-ceiling crap is already messing with the bond market. The Treasury has been issuing fewer short-term Treasury bills, which screwed up trading and caused crazy fluctuations in rates. People are flocking to safe assets like Treasurys, expecting them to rally big time.

 Wall Street and the global financial system are on the edge of a freaking cliff.  Ditched my NVDA and AMD holdings on Thursday and made some sweet tendies. It's time to GTFO before this shit show gets real. You better do the same, my fellow degenerates! 💸🚀",2023-05-26

Is there potential to short NVDA?,2023-05-19
"
I was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. 

I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.

I do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.

Seems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts seems legitimate. What do you guys think?",2023-05-19

DD: NVDA to $700 by this time next year,2023-05-18
"**The A100 is the current market leader for AI tasks at $10,000-$18,000 per card. Its purchased by every major cloud vendor.**

https://preview.redd.it/m0d8s7zbpn0b1.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4744071f5ed7ca45f9886a5d4e00385e783d951a

[https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/)

**The A100 is the market leader because it has ASIC cores that accelerate the major ML libraries such as pytorch and tensorflow. Other vendors are years behind nvidia.**

* The market for HPC AI cards is currently $10B. Overall HPC market is $35B. Market projections are 20%-40% growth in AI HPC buys over the next 5 years. In the worst case projection that market becomes $25B, best case is $54B. Add in all HPC buys, and the projection for 2028 sits around $50B-$80B.
* Nvidia's current revenue is $24B split into gaming, embedded, HPC, and other markets, so there is a good case for it tripling revenue in 5 years just based on AI growth.

https://preview.redd.it/be28h4tdpn0b1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5fb26a7deceb7f0952ef049a3d31471aa66c5299

* There is currently a chip surplus, so Nvidia revenue is down overall because of reduced demand in other markets, but this is projected to change
* However, AI chips use the latest node processes from fabs (predominantly TSMC for AI), which are much more supply constrained than the overall chip market. The overall chip market is predominantly older processes.
* The A100 is currently selling over MSRP because firms are madly trying to scoop them up. In fact it is backordered by a month and a half on all major public vendors.
* This means nvidia is losing at least a month and a half of AI HPC revenue this year already due to supply problems. If they were not supply constrained, revenue would beat last year.
* Long term, Nvidia can renegotiate fab contracts to outbid other chip designers. Apple outbid everyone for the latest TSMC 5nm node process for their M1 chips, but seeing as A100s are being sold by scalpers for almost double MSRP, Nvidia can change this in coming years.

This is the original reason NVDA is going up. **Are NVDA detractors right saying its overvalued now that it has gone up almost 200% from lows this year? Yes its overvalued based even on the generous projected revenue above.**

Then why is it continuing to go up? Other factors for why NVDA is going up:

* Market tailwind from tech stocks overall going up. This can account for 1/3 of NVDA's rise, and will continue to dramatically effect it.
* Index funds rebalancing. NVDA is on the Nasdaq-100 which is tracked by many mutual funds and etfs. These funds are buying NVDA to rebalance their market-cap weighted portfolios.
* The ""IT"" stock. Investors are craving another crazy stock to cash in on. They've seen a stock as dumb as a certain video game store go to the moon, so why not a company that actually has some fundamentals?

Why $700 next year:

* Nasdaq-100 will go up at least 30%. This gives a baseline of $400 for NVDA next year
* The AI gold rush won't stop for another three years. NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL are the only public stocks that are well positioned to benefit from AI. NVDA is the public company, as a proportion of its revenue, that will be affected the most. This makes it the best company to invest in if you believe AI is the next miracle (I don't). This will mean it will outperform the market. Lets say another 30% on top of the market or $500 by next year this time
* FOMO. All you regards who just want to make money will jump on the bandwagon. This will be around another 60% of today's value. All that together is 120%, and gives us $700.

**Proof I'm putting my money where my mouth is below. My plan is to hold for one year.**

"This was a brutal day to trade. This felt like a few weeks ago where all the technicals were completely detached. Very tough trading today and honestly the fact that I basically broke even (slightly red day) is impressive as I felt like this was a big L of a day. 

This also reminded me of late 2022 where I would enter a position and almost immediately be down 5-10%... I haven’t seen that happen in a long time. IT was very weird and there were so many times I felt like premiums didn’t make any sense compared to the actual underlying. Frustrating day but a good reminder that we exploit the days that fit our strategy and we just survive the days that don’t without suffering major losses. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6z8le3psq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7680f4c2f65344ac291f0ebbf6131825af65ce68

As of right now surprisingly we did not establish a new demand today… we came very close (had we closed over 415 we would have)… so this means 1 of 2 things… first, this means that this was a fake breakout and that we tomorrow will see a massive rejection tomorrow to close at 410.2 or below… OR it means tomorrow we establish a new demand (Support) and we bounce. 

Now when we look at other things like the DMI which did start a wave up (bullish) and momentum still being bullish (not extreme) one would favor a breakout tomorrow to put a new demand in. However, this is anyones game for tomorrow right now. 

From a weekly supply/ demand stand point we are as of now set to make a new 418.59 supply and take out 416.08 supply. We also are holding the support of the 411.46 demand. 

The ideal bear close tomorrow is under 411.46 and the ideal bull close is over 416.08. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h2ge4o7tq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a311c28180c7002eec379a170a17acc732a95218

Price action wise we did manage to come back up and retake the daily 8ema resistance. The one interesting thing is that we closed a doji. Now this could mean that we reject and push lower tomorrow (would think more of an evening doji star pattern). 

From a price action start point bulls would prefer a close minimally over 417 and bears would prefer a close under 412.4.

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 418.78 -> 419.5  
 Demand- 410.2  
 Support- 414.6 -> 412.4 -> 411   
 Resistance- 417 -> 418.6

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9dje99ntq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4231c8854754e7512c41c0983c132a2faa5b4657

From a supply and demand stand point futures also did not put in a new demand here… however, we may see that happen if that moves up overnight. However, we would certainly need a daily close over the 4160 area in order to establish a new one. 

If we do put a new one in our upside target would be 4198. However, if this was a failed breakout/ recovery then our target would be 4127 again tomorrow and eventually 4075. 

From a weekly stand point we are set to put a new supply in at 4200 to take our 4192 supply. We are still bouncing off 4130 demand too. Bears want a close under 4130 and bulls want a closure over 4200. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5wtuyn1uq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9cf8e4946912109fdc651a74db695e51f5b489a7

On futures bulls failed to retake the daily 8ema here but did retake the daily 20ema. With a downside to upside doji this actually to me looks more bearish in nature and could see us with a sell off overnight and into tomorrow. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that we are going into a 3 day weekend and I believe with no debt ceiling being signed today that they will not be meeting until Tuesday. That could cause markets to want to sell off and be risk off into the long 3 day weekend (friendly reminder markets are closed Monday!).

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4216 -> 4209 -> 4055  
 Demand- 4198 -> 4128  
 Support- 4158 -> 4126 -> 4110  
 Resistance- 4172 -> 4188 -> 4208

**QQQ SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u8gy0jjuq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47dff0613041517124523b2b600c330de0397be3

Now this is where QQQ completely differs from SPY… here you can see we did indeed close out a bullish abandoned baby reversal… in doing so we put in a new 331.35 demand and now we are pushing upwards. 

The one interesting thing here is that we actually in gapping up like this are now seeing a possible bearish abandoned bearish reversal formed too… The daily DMI is waving up which gives further upside favor but if we got a hard rejection or drop tomorrow we actually likely will turn 339.72 into a new supply (resistance) and would look to retest 337.6 and possibly even 331.35 again. 

From a weekly stand point the DMI is very overbought here and we have still not put a new weekly supply in. We have our next major level at 361.85. Bulls would like a closure anywhere over 335-340 and bear ideally need a closure under 330. 

QQQ Daily Levels  
 Supply- 347.11 -> 337.6 -> 326.82  
 Demand- 336.37 -> 331.35 -> 325.99

**VIX** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e7hbrq5vq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3de28101d61d7ad29bd02af4019de508804ae47c

As I was suspecting the VIX did reject. I was thinking that closure under 20.08 would lead to a downside move on VIX and would also lead to an upside move on SPY. Now one thing here to keep in mind is that 18.86 is a strong support area followed by 17.97. If SPY bears can bounce us off 18.86 tomorrow again then we could look to close over 20.08 to end the week and head into a 3 day weekend. In doing so could see the doji rejection play out here on spy daily. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

https://preview.redd.it/qx3vo5jvq12b1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=88585d6e1ee3a7a1bde23f23cecdeff855b7a3fc

Honestly the fact that I closed just barely red today blows my mind as I truly felt like the whole day was a massive L. I have some pretty solid concrete rules for entries and exits. Today I just could not find a good entry to save my life. Today was definitely the type of day that if you wait for confirmation you already were too late and bought the top or bottom. There was also the lovely morning where SPY price action completely inversed what VOLD was doing. Honestly my thoughts on a day like today is that when big cap like NVDA is up 25-30% that the internals go completely wack and we are just left with poor technicals to trade. When you step back at the EOD it clearly was a range day today, however, it was not like our usual range days with clear set techncials for entries. 

I also a lot of times found as soon as I entered into a position that the premium almost seemed lagged and would instantly hit me 5-7%... there was a lot of times too where there seemed almost like a 3-5 second delay on price action versus premium. I watched a few solid candle drops on SPY and the put I had qued didn’t move at all and then all of a sudden it would be a $2 pump on premium. 

Tough day to trade but I look forward to a better day tomorrow.",2023-05-25

"NVDA price targets are batting 1,000 - Free money machine",2023-05-18
"Every price target set has been or will be (e.g 350 this morning) hit. Not even Cramer being bullish has cause any harm to this behemoth. 
This is the first stock that analyst are perfect with.

Earnings next week are gonna send this to at least 325 regardless of the fact there is no justification for this company to be valued at 800 billion and have a net income of around 1.5 billion. But Ai will be said at least 25 times and every time it is said 1 dollar will be added. Google went with 64 times so I expect nvda to do at least one AI per 30 seconds.

Bears for the love of God stop shorting this, go burn your money in a pile at least then you get some heat as a return. Your yearly tax deduction is already good for 100 years and it is only May.",2023-05-18

Nvidia's AI Chip Boom and the Future of AI,2023-05-26
"🚀🚀🚀 Fellow astronauts, let's take a moment to appreciate the wonder that is Nvidia (NVDA), the powerhouse that's been soaring higher than a SpaceX Starship and shows no signs of slowing down. Let's look at some recent news and why we should keep our diamond hands ready.

Nvidia had an absolute barnburner of a year in 2023. The share price has more than doubled, with the company's market valuation hitting an astronomical $940bn (£760bn). After a fantastic early trading session that saw the share price rise by 25%, the stock topped out at $385.84 a share. Nvidia is riding the wave of AI demand, specifically for generative AI products like ChatGPT, which require massive data centers packed with their semiconductor chips.

Nvidia recently reported Q2 revenues of $7.2bn, smashing Wall Street's predictions by 10%. The company also made an ambitious forecast of $11bn in revenues for Q3, which is more than 50% higher than Wall Street's estimate of $7.2bn. Matt Bryson from Wedbush Securities said Nvidia ""absolutely blew away prior expectations”.

Mark Lipacis from Jefferies bank believes that Nvidia’s growing data centre revenues could even surpass the combined sales of central processing units from Intel and AMD, two of the stalwart chipmaker.

But it's not just about the numbers; it's about the future. Nvidia is at the forefront of AI, the big trend that everyone and their grandmother wants to get into. Companies are scrambling to integrate AI into their businesses, and that's a goldmine for Nvidia. They make the hardware needed to run the complex AI models, and they're ramping up their supply to meet the surging demand.

However, with all great opportunities come challenges. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has voiced concerns over trade restrictions that could cause ""enormous damage."" The geopolitics of the US and China are increasingly affecting chip companies, but Nvidia is still going strong.

In summary, Nvidia's booming business and its strategic position in the rapidly growing AI market make it a stock worth watching for all of us here at Wallstreetbets. Keep in mind that the rocket ride might have its bumps due to geopolitical factors, but as we know, that's all part of the journey to the moon.

P.S -this isn't financial advice. 🚀🚀🚀

P.P.S. - ""Stonks only go up"" is an investment strategy",2023-05-26

What to do with Stock Based Compensation?,2023-05-26
"Hey guys I was reading over some company filings as earnings season is in effect and I had an accounting question.

Free cash flow is typically found by just taking the operating cash flow and subtracting the general expenses (CAPEX) following all operation activity. However, stock based compensation gets included into operating cash flow activities and therefore adds to the free cash flow total.

This led me to wonder if I should subtract the stock based compensation from the total cash flow as stock based compensation is actually just a non-cash expense of the business and does dilute existing shareholders. This is shockingly significant however as many newer and mostly tech companies generate ridiculous amounts of there cash flow from stock based compensation which is extremely deceptive (ex. ADSK, TEAM, PLTR, NVDA, SNOW, CRM)

This led me to ask if it makes sense to subtract stock based compensation from cash flow , include it in cash flow, or something else.

What do you guys think?",2023-05-26

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-26.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean ""cheaper."" High numbers mean ""expensive."" A 1 means ""fairly"" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.
* **How should this be improved?** Do you have any suggestions or notice any bugs with this report?",2023-05-25
