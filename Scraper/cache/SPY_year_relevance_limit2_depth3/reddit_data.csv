Started with $12 last Monday. Bought 2 SPY 410p for Tuesday then started blowing up.,2023-05-10,"['start', 'Monday', 'buy', 'spy', 'Tuesday', 'start', 'blow']",0.0
Took the gains from SPY and shorted SBUX for earnings. Then took part of that and shorted IEP. From there shorted PYPL earnings. Then shorted ABNB. Now shorting CMG is currently my only open position.,2023-05-10,"['take', 'gain', 'SPY', 'shorted', 'SBUX', 'earning', 'take', 'shorted', 'IEP', 'shorted', 'PYPL', 'earning', 'short', 'abnb', 'short', 'CMG', 'currently', 'open', 'position']",0.0

I turned 17k into 86k then cashed out.  That was 3 years ago.  I have lost every subsequent deposit since then.  More recently I turned 500 to 5k in 3 days then back to 200 in 2 days.

"I opened some SPY puts yesterday and they expire today. Yesterday I was up nearly $5,000 and I know for sure they would be up $500,000 today. 

I contacted a RH special agent specialist to make sure I can sell my puts for $500,000 today. He said it was stupid and dumb but I’m pretty sure he confirmed it. Please check the attached screenshot for proof. 

Well turned out they actually expired yesterday. But my phone was dead during market close so I didn’t get to close them and they expired “worthless”.

This is unacceptable and I am suing Robinhood for $500,000 due to the negligence of their company and their inability to provide accurate value to my incredible investments!!",2023-05-02,"['open', 'spy', 'put', 'yesterday', 'expire', 'today', 'yesterday', 'nearly', 'know', 'sure', 'today', 'contact', 'RH', 'special', 'agent', 'specialist', 'sure', 'sell', 'put', 'today', 'say', 'stupid', 'dumb', 'pretty', 'sure', 'confirm', 'check', 'attach', 'screenshot', 'proof', 'turn', 'actually', 'expire', 'yesterday', 'phone', 'dead', 'market', 'close', 'close', 'expire', 'worthless', 'unacceptable', 'sue', 'Robinhood', 'negligence', 'company', 'inability', 'provide', 'accurate', 'value', 'incredible', 'investment']",0.09515306122448978
