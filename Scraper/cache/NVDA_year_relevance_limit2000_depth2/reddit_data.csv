Gather round the campfire returds, 
🪵 🔥 

Ye who would hear a tale of the market's ebb and flows, heed my words and listen well. For riches come and riches go, and with them tales of heaven and hell.

Once upon a time, in the land of Btfdville, there was a bold bear. He went by Rizzly, for it seemed the markets favored his every move. He believed he had charmed the capricious
mistress of fortune, gracefully doing the tango with she who is known as the cruel mistress herself. Word of his astute short-selling abilities spread like wildfire, and soon he was the talk of the town. What also gave him hella clout was his savage remarks regarding his stock market activities.

""The only thing sweeter than honey is shorting regional bank stocks to the ground"".
""Why is it that when stocks go DOWN, my PP go UP?""
“Idk whats falling harder, the bulls' dignity, your wife's panties, the Titanic or this stock I just shorted"".

Wherever he went , ""off colour"" remarks were expressed.

At the 5 star Michelin restaurant he could now afford going to, he told the waitress: I'll take a juicy bull steak and a stock that I can mercilessly crush into oblivion, thank you. And the drink? Shareholder tears, on the rocks plz"".
At the funeral of his aunt, Mama Bear: ""This stock l'm shorting is deader than her. It'll join my aunt, Harambe, and
 FRC in the afterlife shortly. Load up on puts, trust me bro"".
At his wedding to Burry: ""I take you as my beloved spouse, to have and to hold, and to mercilessly short stocks with, until profit do us part. As we embark on this bearish journey, let us unite our portfolios and short investment thesis"".

In Rizzley's hometown of Btfdville, most ppl were chill. Being a bull was the status quo while being a bear was a no go. Rizzley always felt that this was unfair, which is why the bulls' ego he wanted to tear. Rizzley, always a contrarian at heart, wanted to break their illusion apart. He prowled the investing landscape for the most robust stock, seeking the bulls' cherished gem among the flock. Lo and behold  Nvidia,bursting with buying pressure and bullish charisma. Rizzley found his target, and set about to make the stock bleed red like Target.
He wrote various DD's on WSB, spamming the post with meteor emojis ☄️☄️☄️. Rizzley put up his short thesis flyers in various places in Btfdville, the parks, stop signs, Wendy's, even on the traffic lights' red circle 🔴 . He married his brother to the Hindenburg Research CIO. He shared his rationale to various renowned publications of his town, such as the Grizzly Gazzete, Regarded Writings and Crayon Chronicles. He even released a book, ""The Bear's Den: Where Optimism Goes to Hibernate"". In it, he was quoted as saying ""bulls are like ostriches with their heads in the sand. They refuse to see the truth. All of this Al talk is hype lol. They'll learn soon enough, the hard way hopefully"".

Convinced NVIDIA would fall, and WSB's bearish echo chamber bolstering his appetite, he went all in on NDA puts.
He sold everything he had, including himself (worked extra shifts behind Wendy's dumpster). Believing this play wouldn't go tits up, he decided to hibernate. When he will wake up, he'd be richer than Jordan Belfort in 98’. After 69 days, he rose from his slumber, first thing he did is look at Lambos and was stuck on what color. After he ordered on uber his supper (salmon seasoned with bulls' crushed hopes and dreams, the more the better), he sat at his monitor and viewed his portfolio. To his utter
dismay, NVIDIA had made a ALL TIME HIGH TODAY (currently at $295.47). His portfolio was shredded , pain in his heart now embedded. His puts now nearly worthless, shattered the bear who was once fearless. He didn't know what to say, think, or do, only managed a GUH as ControltheNarrative did too.
He eventually regained some composure, and begged the market for this to be over. When he shouted ""THIS ISNT FAIR"", that’s his mans, Burry, walked in, ""Honey, your salmon
is here, seasoned perfectly to our liking, tonight, we shall feast like vikings.” With tears streaming down his face, Rizzly knew that he had just lost their place 🏡. The monitor, with one hand he tried to cover, and with the other halt his mate's enter. However, it was too late. Burry saw the look on Rizzly's face and [knew of their fate](https://ibb.co/xmXSZjc).

Alas, my fellow regards, he was never a bear, but an ostrich with too much flair.
And I, what positions do I hold? Why 30 NVIDIA 285p's of course, all told.

 “This is a fanciful tale about a character named Rizzly, who is a stock market bear - meaning he anticipates a decrease in market prices, and profits by short-selling stocks. He is known for his boldness and wit, often making darkly humorous remarks about his short-selling activities.

In this tale, Rizzly lives in a town where bullish (optimistic) sentiment is the norm, but he revels in being a contrarian. He sets his sights on the stock of the tech company Nvidia (NVDA), believing it is overvalued and will fall. He creates detailed posts (DDs or due diligence) on the subreddit WallStreetBets (WSB), trying to convince others of his belief. He's so convinced that Nvidia's stock price will fall that he invests heavily in ""puts"", a type of option contract that increases in value when the underlying stock's price decreases.

To fund this investment, Rizzly even works extra shifts, believing that the payoff will be worth it. After making his investment, he metaphorically hibernates, waiting for his prediction to come true. However, when he wakes up, he discovers that Nvidia's stock price has actually reached an all-time high, and his investment in put options is now nearly worthless. This loss is devastating to him.

The story concludes with a twist, suggesting that Rizzly was not really a bear but an ostrich, a metaphor for someone who ignores inconvenient truths.

* Nvidia's current revenue is $24B split into gaming, embedded, HPC, and other markets, so there is a good case for it tripling revenue in 5 years just based on AI growth.

https://preview.redd.it/be28h4tdpn0b1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5fb26a7deceb7f0952ef049a3d31471aa66c5299

* There is currently a chip surplus, so Nvidia revenue is down overall because of reduced demand in other markets, but this is projected to change
* However, AI chips use the latest node processes from fabs (predominantly TSMC for AI), which are much more supply constrained than the overall chip market. The overall chip market is predominantly older processes.
* The A100 is currently selling over MSRP because firms are madly trying to scoop them up. In fact it is backordered by a month and a half on all major public vendors.
* This means nvidia is losing at least a month and a half of AI HPC revenue this year already due to supply problems. If they were not supply constrained, revenue would beat last year.
* Long term, Nvidia can renegotiate fab contracts to outbid other chip designers. Apple outbid everyone for the latest TSMC 5nm node process for their M1 chips, but seeing as A100s are being sold by scalpers for almost double MSRP, Nvidia can change this in coming years.

This is the original reason NVDA is going up. **Are NVDA detractors right saying its overvalued now that it has gone up almost 200% from lows this year? Yes its overvalued based even on the generous projected revenue above.**

Then why is it continuing to go up? Other factors for why NVDA is going up:

* Market tailwind from tech stocks overall going up. This can account for 1/3 of NVDA's rise, and will continue to dramatically effect it.
* Index funds rebalancing. NVDA is on the Nasdaq-100 which is tracked by many mutual funds and etfs. These funds are buying NVDA to rebalance their market-cap weighted portfolios.
* The ""IT"" stock. Investors are craving another crazy stock to cash in on. They've seen a stock as dumb as a certain video game store go to the moon, so why not a company that actually has some fundamentals?

Why $700 next year:

* Nasdaq-100 will go up at least 30%. This gives a baseline of $400 for NVDA next year
* The AI gold rush won't stop for another three years. NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL are the only public stocks that are well positioned to benefit from AI. NVDA is the public company, as a proportion of its revenue, that will be affected the most. This makes it the best company to invest in if you believe AI is the next miracle (I don't). This will mean it will outperform the market. Lets say another 30% on top of the market or $500 by next year this time
* FOMO. All you regards who just want to make money will jump on the bandwagon. This will be around another 60% of today's value. All that together is 120%, and gives us $700.

**Proof I'm putting my money where my mouth is below. My plan is to hold for one year.**

"NVDA may hold promise for the future, but its current Price to Earnings (PE) and Price to Sales (PS) ratios are less than impressive. Earnings appear stagnant, with PC gaming in decline. The majority of their profit is derived from data services, rather than Al.

Moreover, we're grappling with the debt ceiling limit. When analyzing patterns from past 'blood weeks', history shows NVDA experienced a 30% drop during such events. The economic outlook is not favorable and there's a downward trend, as evidenced by the overvaluation of PPD. Despite being hyped and exceeding $100 due to strong buying pressure for a significant period, it now faces a 40% reduction.

Add to that the ongoing uncertainty around the China trade war, and you have a multitude of reasons contributing to a potential decrease in the stock's value.

Disclosure: I hold over 17k short positions in NVDA. My investment track record is far from flawless - I lost approximately 80k last March and, to date, Fidelity has yet to retrieve my funds.

Not sure how we can verify any of that. It's an interesting thought nonetheless.

"Remember all those ""valuation is too high"" gay bears?

NVDA guided for 50% QoQ revenue growth. MY FUCKING GOD. That is insane for a company that just printed a $7B quarter.

edit: the gay bears are STILL posting garbage about their backwards looking P/E. Amazing.

Assuming some amount of growth (and price increases) they will likely be pulling down over $60B in revenues next year. with insane margins (75%?)

Scott McNeely was the CEO of Sun Microsystems, one of the darlings of the tech bubble (around year 2000). At its peak his stock hit valuation of ten-times revenues. A couple of years afterward he had this to say about that time (via Bloomberg):

At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64?

"Posts like this are like a good cup of soup with a hearty broth on a cold day. I don’t ever wish anyone harm, but every failure she or anyone has is a chance for a wake up call, so have no problems in enjoying this catastrophe. Very pleasant and soothing indeed. The consistency and magnitude of these L’s are almost meditative.

The days come and go. My life is happening, things are always changing. Yet with all this constant motion, Cathie Woods consistently drops the worst trades like clockwork. A steady, colossal, drip of Ls. Every loss she takes is so big it’s scale is lost on my simple mind. Yet there they go. One by one. Each loss and failure measured on a celestial scale that is beyond my grasp. Bigger Ls than I can understand with dollar amounts bigger than what I’ve ever seen or may ever see. I know that no matter what happens in my small little life, Cathie is out there, in the ether, losing more money than I could ever even know.

Cathie’s Ls loom over us all in the aether, dripping so mightily. How could us, such small beings, be bound by the same force of time as such colossal and awe inspiring losses? Yet here we are. If time is a big enough place for Cathie’s losses to exist, then how small must we be… in the grand scheme of time.

"what OP did was extremely risky. Ignore whoever says ""oh there was a X% chance in my favor"" and all that bullshit. Also ignore the ""I could tell this was overhyped and it was time it went down"" and all the other coping bias. 

The fact is simple. He sold uncovered calls, so should NVDA gone up that day he would have lost his ass, pure and simple. He was just lucky it didn't. Any discussion around timing this shit is just pure confirmation bias. Noone can time it. The same arguments could be had for NVDA a few days ago and anyone who did this would have gotten their asses handed to them.

OP sold and closed intraday, on expiring day, which is as low as margin as you can require (had he done this at the beginning of the week the risk/reward would have been waaaaay off what you see here).

He got lucky, good for him and he should enjoy it, but make no mistake in thinking this is repeatable by design.

Also, uncovered calls or puts = you stand to lose way more than the margin impact etc. because any unexpected news or announcement can make the stock rocket, no matter whether it's true/real/meaningful. The market can, and will inevitably, screw you if you take risks you don't understand. 

Remember after NVDA earnings how many posts were on the front page with people celebrating their massive wins? Now, keep in mind if NVDA had unremarkable earnings they would have ALL lost their money, but you wouldn't see anyone posting about it, which makes you think how much losses go on around earnings that people don't post online.

You need to bear in mind that Options were conceived and created to hedge, that's it. They were not designed to be used as investing or betting instruments. Now, retail has popularized and repurposed them as quick-win instruments, or go-big-or-bust. However, humans are terrible - absolutely terrible - at judging risk, and therefore they almost all inevitably lose their shirts.

If you happen to read the booklet your broker gives you when you sign up for options trading they explicitly tell you that 85% of option traders lose capital in the first year. This tells you that it's not randomness. It's by design against use as an investing instrument. In essence, the premiums paid for options are calculated so that only extraordinary price moves result to profits (hence the hedging purpose).

"Naked calls are inversely proportional to the price of the security.  Since the prices of any particular stock have no ceiling to them- the market controls the price- technically there is no bottom to how much you can owe.

It’s one of the few ways you can lose more than you put up.   Since prices (theoretically) can go to infinity, your losses can go to infinity.

Further, the quarterly report explicitly addressed that this filing was coming purely for administrative purposes and that they actually have no plans to use it anytime soon (ie no dilution at all anytime soon).

"Nvidia almost died 3 times in its 30-year history.

CEO Jensen Huang shared these near-death stories at a commencement speech last night.

Here's what he said:

LESSON 1: Have the humility to confront failure and ask for help

Nvidia's first big 3D chip contract was for Sega's new game console. 

From Jensen:

""After one year of development, we realized our architecture was the wrong strategy...

I contacted the CEO of Sega and suggested that they should find another partner. But I also needed Sega to pay us in full or Nivida would be out of business. 

I was embarrassed to ask. The CEO of Sega, to his credit and to my amazement, agreed. His understanding and generosity gave us six months to survive.

Confronting our mistake, and with humility, asking for help, saved Nvidia. These traits are the hardest for the brightest and most successful.""

LESSON 2: Endure the pain and suffering needed to realize your dream

In 2007, Nvidia announced CUDA, a new computing model for GPUs. 

From Jensen:

""Creating a new computing model is incredibly hard...Nvidia's profits took a significant hit...

We suffered many years of poor performance. 

Our shareholders were skeptical of CUDA and preferred we focused on improving profitability. But we persevered...

This journey forged our character to endure the pain and suffering that is always needed to realize a vision.""

LESSON 3: Make sacrifices for your life's work

In 2010, Nvidia had the lead in the mobile chip market. But then the competition came in.

From Jensen:

""The phone market is huge; we could have chosen to fight for share. Instead, we made a hard decision and sacrificed the market...

Nvidia's mission is to build computers to solve problems that ordinary computers cannot. 

We should dedicate ourselves to realizing our vision...

Our strategic retreat paid off. By leaving the phone market, we opened our minds to invent a new one.

To retreat from a giant phone market to create a $0 billion market was a risky move, but it paid off. 

Retreat does not come easily to the brightest people, yet strategic retreat, sacrifice, and deciding what to give up is at the very core of success.""

//

Jensen wrapped up the speech with this:

""Run don't walk. Either you're running for food, or you are running from being food:

1. Have the humility to confront failure and ask for help.
2. Endure the pain needed to realize your dream.
3. Make sacrifices for your life's work.""

Microsoft was the largest tech company @ 281bn market cap.

In 2023, it is AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN then NVDA.

MSFT - the largest company back then was 2.8 times larger than AAPL back then.

AAPL today is 2.8 times larger than NVDA now.

In 1983, the largest company was worth ~30bn.

In 2003, the largest company was worth ~300bn.

In 2023, the largest company is worth 2750bn.

"

Listen folks, there was not enough trade volume to trust the current price of NVDA. It looks like there were a bunch of people buying, and no one selling and that pumped the price due to artificial scarcity. When the profit taking begins, the share price will fall rapidly. It will probably hold on to most of its gains as there will also be more buyers and not just more sellers in a higher volume environment.

If you won your NVDA, it will be a max dash to take your profits tomorrow morning. I suggest liquidating during pre market.

All y’all with huge unrealized gains on your options, hopefully you’re still ITM after pre market price action. Expect huge slippage when you’re selling your calls if you’re not deep ITM when options trading resumes. 


What happens after the pre market and opening sell off? FOMO dip buyers, scalpers, and passive funds rebalancing will help stem the losses to a degree. Or, the market will see a falling knife and steer clear.

"Actually over 60M, which is a lot more than the use 20-30M they experience. I suppose if volume drifts back to its usual levels the price could drift down too but I'm not necessarily buying the idea of a large, sustained fall. I could see a short term pullback acting as a bear trap.

In fact I am currently betting on that outcome with a ladder of buy orders at lower price points - maybe I'm wrong and miss the market (quite likely tbh) but we'll see. There was a lot of short action at market open yesterday. Not complaining though: I made £2,400 on NVDA on ladders of very small £0.05/pt buy positions, £1,600 on the night of the earnings call, and another £800 yesterday.

*(Basically I'm trying to get actually decent at trading with very low value trades that risk small amounts of money before I go big. That did require quite a bit of self restraint the day before yesterday though. My total position of £20p/point netted £1,600 and I keep having to stop myself from thinking about if I'd YOLOed, at about £4/point, which would have maxxed my margin, I would have made £30-40k - basically doubling the value of my account - but, of course, if you can make that much in 90 minutes, you can also lose it that quickly too, so I'll keep it low risk for now.)*",2023-05-26,"['actually', 'M', 'lot', 'use', 'm', 'experience', 'suppose', 'volume', 'drift', 'usual', 'level', 'price', 'drift', 'necessarily', 'buy', 'idea', 'large', 'sustained', 'fall', 'short', 'term', 'pullback', 'act', 'bear', 'trap', 'fact', 'currently', 'bet', 'outcome', 'ladder', 'buy', 'order', 'low', 'price', 'point', 'maybe', 'wrong', 'miss', 'market', 'likely', 'tbh', 'lot', 'short', 'action', 'market', 'open', 'yesterday', 'complain', 'NVDA', 'ladder', 'small', 'pt', 'buy', 'position', 'night', 'earning', 'yesterday', 'basically', 'try', 'actually', 'decent', 'trade', 'low', 'value', 'trade', 'risk', 'small', 'amount', 'money', 'big', 'require', 'bit', 'self', 'restraint', 'day', 'yesterday', 'total', 'position', 'point', 'net', 'have', 'stop', 'think', 'YOLOed', 'point', 'maxxe', 'margin', 'basically', 'double', 'value', 'account', 'course', 'minute', 'lose', 'quickly', 'low', 'risk']",-0.03662131519274377

" (Bloomberg) -- **Cathie Wood’s flagship exchange-traded fund closed out  its Nvidia Corp. stake in early January**. Then, came the artificial  intelligence frenzy that sent the stock and its big tech peers on a  tear.

The chipmaker has added around $560 billion in market  capitalization since Wood dumped her shares — with the last $200 billion  of that surge coming overnight after the company handily beat earnings.

Although  Wood holds Nvidia across several of her smaller funds, investors in the  flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) have mostly been left out of  this year’s blistering 161.58% rally.

**In February, when Nvidia traded for $234 a share, roughly 50 times forward earnings, Wood said the valuation was “very high.”**

“We  like Nvidia, we think it’s going to be a good stock. It’s priced —it’s  the ‘check-the-box’ AI company,” Wood told CNBC on Feb 27. “For a  flagship fund, where we’ve consolidated towards our highest conviction  names, part of that has to do with valuation.”

A spokesperson for ARK Investment Management said the company doesn’t comment on trading activity. 

Wood has been a long-time fan of Nvidia, but her conviction on the stock has wavered at times.

I made around 181k (in USD) in profits, and this account went from 38k to around 219k (in USD)

I am now DCA into dividend stocks over the next few weeks, mixed in with some ""growth"" stocks mixed in that still pay a little dividend. Some of you were asking which dividend stocks I plan to buy, and this is not financial advice and DYOR but they include: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA (very small opening position at this price), JPM, SBUX, KO, PG, and O.

Of these, at today's (May 25, 2023) prices, my fav starting price positions are for SBUX and O (think these are good price for these 2 stocks especially). Again, not financial advice.

Happy to collect dividends from this portfolio going forward!

The key is to diversify buy stocks which have long-term potential that are in stage three or four out of 10 of an expansion.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), a leading chipmaker and AI company is on a tear recently, with its stock price hitting $389.46 on May 26, 2023 - a nearly 30% jump since the last earnings report. Contrastingly, the broader economic, geopolitical, and social environment send signals of uncertainty. The market's volatility index (VIX), which currently rests at a relatively low level of 17.95 hints at an imminent  downturn, indicating complacency among investors. However, it's important to remember that markets are complex and frequently behave contrary to expectations.

While the broader market seems calm, one sector, in particular, is leading the trend: the technology sector with chipmakers and AI companies are seeing a significant uptick.

**The big question is, should we dive in or wait it out?**

Before we get into that, let's be clear, this analysis is not financial advice. It's meant to shed some light that help us make better-informed decisions.

Let's get into it!

Nvidia's fundamentals are robust, but that's not our focus today. With the company venturing into high-growth territory and emotional responses overpowering rational data, we're turning our attention to technical analysis for potential insight into future movements.

To begin, we can see the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for NVDA is at 83.62, suggesting an overbought condition, which is typically considered when the RSI is above 70. This high RSI value might imply that the stock is due for a short-term pullback, as observed in NVDA's historical performance.

In the past, NVDA's RSI crossed the extreme overbought line of 80 five times: on Feb. 19, 2020, Sept. 2, 2020, July 6, 2021, and Nov. 8, 2021. Each time this occurred, there was a short-term pullback in the stock price ranging from 5.0% to 38.9% over periods from three sessions to a month. However, in each case, the stock reached a new record high within three months of the pullback.

Previously, a pattern referred to as bearish technical divergence was observed, which suggests that rallies are taking more and more out of the bulls, leaving them vulnerable to bear attacks. This pattern emerged in Nov. 2021 when the stock kept rising to a record $333.76 on Nov. 29, 2021, while the RSI was actually trending lower to a sub-overbought reading of 69.53 that day. This was followed by a significant 11-month bear market, where the price plunged 66.4% before bottoming at $112.27 on Oct. 14, 2022.

NVDA's price is currently close to the Fibonacci resistance level of $394.8. If it breaks this resistance, the next key level to watch would be $483.48. On the other hand, if the price declines, the Fibonacci levels of $364.09, $360.93, and $339.98 could provide support.

Fibonacci extension is another technical tool to identify possible resistance.The most common Fibonacci extension levels are 1.618, 2.618, and 4.236.

Let's calculate the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level for NVDA:

1. Subtract the low from the high to get the difference: 394.80 - 108.13 = 286.67
2. Multiply the difference by the Fibonacci ratio: 286.67 \* 1.618 = 464.02
3. Add the result to the low price: 108.13 + 464.02 = 572.15

However, please note that these levels are theoretical and while they can often serve as areas of support or resistance, they're not guaranteed to hold.

In summary, NVDA has been experiencing a strong upward trend across all these periods. This is accompanied by high trading volumes, suggesting robust investor interest. Given the strength of this upward trend and high trading volumes, it could be surmised that the market sentiment towards NVDA is bullish.

During the past 13 years, the highest PE Ratio of NVIDIA was 224.98. The lowest was 13.68. And the median was 39.94

&#x200B;

**So, where do we stand?**

Nvidia's underlying fundamentals are strong, yet the recent trading frenzy seems to eclipse these fundamental values. As emotions run high, we're observing price action that is increasingly detached from the stock's intrinsic worth. Anticipate considerable volatility in the coming month, which may lead to substantial capital losses for those choose to trade this stock even though overall sentiment is bullish. That being said, our enthusiasm for NVDA and AI at large is unwavering. We're extremely bullish, and we foresee plenty of upside potential. Despite this, due caution is warranted. Here are our projections and perspectives for the ensuing month:

&#x200B;

**Bear Scenario:**

While we've discussed the bull case for NVDA, it's equally important to consider the potential downside risks. If we look at the Fibonacci retracement levels, $364 emerges as the first potential support level that could hold during this breakout rally. Moreover, during a bull run, the 5-day moving average often provides a level of support while 10-day MA could signal possible weakness, so it's essential to keep an eye on this as well.

One notable aspect of NVDA's recent price action is the significant gap up. This has created a large area that could be 'filled' if the stock were to pull back, which is a common pattern in technical analysis. As such, we could see NVDA potentially retracing to the $320 level, which, given the gap-fill scenario, could serve as a very strong support level.

These are all potential scenarios that could play out in the near term. It's important to monitor these levels and adjust our investment strategies accordingly, always being mindful of both potential upside and downside risks.

&#x200B;

**Bull Scenario:**

On the more optimistic, or bullish, side of the spectrum, we draw upon Tesla's impressive P/E ratio of over 1,000 during its significant rally two years ago. If NVDA were to reach a similar P/E ratio, this would translate to a stock price of $2190. However, considering NVDA's near trillion-dollar market capitalization and current growth rates, reaching such a level would be extremely ambitious. At this stock price, NVDA would have a market cap of an astonishing $5 trillion.

For perspective, Apple, currently the world's most valuable company, has a market cap of $2.7 trillion. If NVDA were to reach the same market cap as Apple, this would equate to a stock price of $1095. However, the market often anticipates such significant milestones and investors may start selling before reaching this psychological barrier.

As NVDA begins to show signs of a meme stock momentum, it’s essential to draw upon historical precedents from similar market movements. Notably, Dogecoin experienced a sharp downturn after it nearly reached the much-anticipated $1 target, peaking at $0.74. AMC's stock price exhibited a similar pattern, retreating after it hit $72. There appears to be a consistent trend of investors taking profits when the price hits approximately 3/4 of a clear target. Given this, if we set a bullish target for NVDA at $1,000, we can anticipate a potential price ceiling in the vicinity of $720, where significant resistance may be encountered. For those seeking to mitigate risk, considering an exit at around $680 could be a prudent strategy. This price corresponds to a market capitalization of $1.68 trillion and a P/E ratio of 355.5. While this is an ambitious target, it's not beyond the realms of possibility given the current rally.

&#x200B;

**Realistic Scenario:**

Based on our analysis of Fibonacci Retracement levels and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio trends, we consider NVDA reaching $480 as the most probable outcome. This represents a potential 23% increase from the current price level. In this scenario, NVDA would have a P/E ratio of 251.31, indicating a market capitalization of approximately $1.18 trillion. This could be an opportune moment to sell, locking in gains before any potential market correction.

While it's also interesting to note that at a P/E ratio of 300, while high, is not unheard of for high-growth tech stocks. This would place NVDA's market cap at around $1.4 trillion and the stock price at approximately $573, which is in line with Fibonacci extension. Given NVDA's strong fundamentals and growth prospects, we believe this could be the upper bounds of realistic outcome.

In conclusion, while trading high volatility stocks with meme stock momentum can be very risky, and has no fundamental backing at this point. It comes down to emotional control and resilience. We believe that a thorough understanding of NVDA's technical and fundamental indicators can guide investment decisions. Please keep in mind that investing involves risk and it is important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

&#x200B;

It's crucial to remain cool-headed and resilient. Knowledge is power, so understand the technical and fundamental indicators to guide your investment decisions. Remember, trading involves risk - don't go all-in without doing your homework and consulting with a professional advisor.

They have definitely pissed of the gaming community with the new 40 series cards and plus PC sales are all time low.

Cloud demand is also on a slump, so AWS and Azure orders for the new datacenter specific cards depends on these demands.

Is there potential to short NVDA?,2023-05-19,"['potential', 'short', 'NVDA']",0.0
"
I was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. 

I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.

I do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.

Seems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts seems legitimate.

"Scott McNeely was the CEO of Sun Microsystems, one of the darlings of the year 2000 tech bubble. At its peak his stock hit valuation of ten-times revenues. A couple of years afterward he had this to say about that time (via Bloomberg):

At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64?

"Similar to tech stocks such as AAPL, MSFT, etc, NVDA is also reaching its long-awaited resistance zone around $277 - $280 and the last time this occurred was in November of 2021 before it faced a 3-month massacre.  


With earnings in about a month and a half, we more than likely will see either a small double top and/or retest before slowly seeing it drift off into a short-term bearish habitat. From there, it will be in the hands of Jensen Huang to showcase the performance of his company on May 24th.

"Don't punk out and avg down 😂

Honestly the ER move is full of lunacy... really just pumped because of AI... when in reality Revenue & Profits are down YoY baaad.

Daily MACD v. PA shows a negative bearish divergence. Once we see buying interest fade a loss of 231 support could see a nice drop back down to these levels:

4hr - 223 Daily - 215 Weekly - as low as 195

If profit taking and sellers do not step in with conviction then this will likely contiue to rip up to test $250-270 (more sellers at these levels).

Also consider your contracts greeks. Took a quick look and looks like you are losing -$126 Daily just for holding based on Delta and this also doesn't even account for intraday price movement of the underlying.

For now, the past two days show that the contact has been trading within a 4.20 (high) - 2.90s (low) range. A breakout of 4.20 could see higher valuations in the contract with targets upward of 7.00 - 12.00 (all depending on underlying strength of move and timing).

Use these like any indicator, with caution. Basically gives you an understanding of when we start going into oversold or overbought territories.

1. This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers.
2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves. Obviously, if there are unexpected poison pills in an earnings report or if there are unexpected positive catalysts, you can move outside the deviations.
3. it's expected that 70% of the time we fall within the range by the end of the week/month/quarter. So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair it together with another tool called RSI. Most people are familiar with RSI. If we break out of the upper expected moves on already high RSI, this can create favorable short setups where you do have probabilities on your side. Now keep in mind point 1 & 2 that I made. You can have overbought + high RSI on individual tickers like MSFT and NVDA because of something that may fundamentally change the company like a new revenue stream. Hence why this is more useful on index-related products.
4. At the end of the day, this is all a game of probability. When you are oversold on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the upside. When you are overbought on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the downside.",2023-05-21,"['use', 'like', 'indicator', 'caution', 'basically', 'give', 'understanding', 'start', 'go', 'oversold', 'overbought', 'territory', 'useful', 'index', 'relate', 'product', 'like', 'qqq', 'spy', 'iwm', 'dia', 'likely', 'volatility', 'relation', 'individual', 'ticker', 'earning', 'market', 'participant', 'place', 'option', 'relate', 'bet', 'cause', 'implied', 'volatility', 'higher', 'expect', 'information', 'help', 'dictate', 'range', 'stock', 'move', 'obviously', 'unexpected', 'poison', 'pill', 'earning', 'report', 'unexpected', 'positive', 'catalyst', 'outside', 'deviation', 'expect', 'time', 'fall', 'range', 'end', 'week', 'month', 'quarter', 'mean', 'hit', 'upper', 'low', 'bound', 'datum', 'oversell', 'overbought', 'condition', 'pair', 'tool', 'call', 'RSI', 'people', 'familiar', 'RSI', 'break', 'upper', 'expect', 'move', 'high', 'RSI', 'create', 'favorable', 'short', 'setup', 'probability', 'mind', 'point', 'overbought', 'high', 'rsi', 'individual', 'ticker', 'like', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'fundamentally', 'change', 'company', 'like', 'new', 'revenue', 'stream', 'useful', 'index', 'relate', 'product', 'end', 'day', 'game', 'probability', 'oversell', 'RSI', 'deviation', 'outside', 'expect', 'probability', 'favor', 'upside', 'overbought', 'RSI', 'deviation', 'outside', 'expect', 'probability', 'favor', 'downside']",0.06346074380165288

"Generally, higher rsi, 70+ makes a stock more risky for a pullback. In terms of probability, it's more probable to see a downside move or sideways consolidation to cool down the rsi. However, high rsi after an earnings pop is normal because we're moving so much in a short period of time. That is why oftentimes you see a stock go sideways for a few days or weeks after a massive upside move one earnings.

I'm thinking markets will be volatile and hope that my puts will eventually print... But, most likely calls will do better. All spy positions are 26 and QQQ's are on 23rd.

For NVDA I was planning to open a call position closer to the day of earnings, because I suspect markets to be swinging back and forth. But, now I'm conflicted, cause I was just bored and looking at some news on CNBC for fun. And came upon this... So yea now Idk I actually kind of agree with Cramer and I know I should inverse myself/Cramer, but this AI hype train is just too FOMO/YOLO/STRONK energy .

"Well going into today I actually found myself to be fairly bullish and I truly expected a bounce and for us to close much higher than we closed yesterday. However, that clearly did not happen and clearly was wrong to be a bull up here. 

Looking at SPY and QQQ daily here it would appear that I was a day early… With SPY and QQQ closing out there abandoned baby daily bullish reversal candles honestly the temptation to swing calls is insanely high… However, I actually back tested my swing trades dating back to early 2022 and I actually am net negative on swings alone… so as much as they are enticing… not worth it to me. 

Now for those of you that don’t know what the abandoned baby pattern is… it’s a rarity and doesn’t always play out but when it does it usually results in a pretty massive move up… May 4th is the best example of that daily pattern.

There is literally nothing else that I can describe this market right now then “WOW.” I Just can not imagine the fact that a company with a PE near 200 can rally almost 27% on earnings and be near the ATHs… that truly is mindboggling. 

This market reminds me a lot of the spring of 2021… 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmxx7f3j1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d3d5cef6baa1526e4ff58e48976169e2ee9afe3

Now from a supply and demand stand point we didn’t do anything different today. The most intriguing thing is the fact that we actually gapped under the 413.05 supply. So generally speaking to have a previous supply taken out you must close a new supply over it and then you must touch that level with price action… a gap down completely changes that metric. So for now that 413.05 level remains on the books. 

We did come down and test 410.2 demand (Support) and hold that nicely today. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema for the first time since May 4th. 

Honestly, I can no help but notice the similarities of todays candle to May 4ths daily candle. If that is the case we likely could see a green open tomorrow and green day tomorrow. This would give us an opportunity to turn 411.16 into a new higher demand. 

However, IF bears can continue this momentum lower then more likely than not our target is daily demand (support) at 404.32/ 405.12. The daily DMI has officially reset to over sold but has not started its wave up. So we are in the early stages of finding the next bottom…. However, keep in mind that the DMI can remain oversold for a period of time before it retraces. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

On the Daily we clearly broke through support of the red and black rising wedge. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema. However, we once again are finding support at the daily 50ema. 

We will keep an eye on this blue bear channel with resistance at 415.2 for tomorrow. In all honestly it appears that I was just one day too early on the bull rally… with NVDA this very well is the dip buy opportunity before we push hard to the 420-430 area again. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 413 -> 418.8  
 Demand- 410.2 -> 405.1  
 Support- 411.1 -> 410.2 -> 408.9  
 Resistance- 412.5 -> 414.1 -> 417.1

Futures came down and took out that 4149 supply that they had fell just short of yesterday. With this log wicked doji I do expect some upside tomorrow. However, the one interesting thing here is that right now this new daily candle has still not tried to put a new demand (support) in… DMI remainds oversold though so favor would be a short term bounce coming soon. 

If we get a green day and green bounce on futures tomorrow with a closure over 4165 then we should try to turn 4145 into a new demand (Support). 

However, if we fall through 4127 demand tomorrow then our target would be 4075 demand. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

Same story here on futes is that we did push a daily candle through the red and black daily rising wedge and now we find ourselves looking at this blue resistance line and that 4159 will be a major resistance to watch that futures actually is hard rejecting after hours here. 

If this is a back test and rejection of the daily 8ema on futures this could be a very bearish movement with the ultimate target being 4095 support. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4055 -> 4208  
 Demand- 4128 -> 4075  
 Support- 4125 -> 4110 -> 4095   
 Resistance- 4159 -> 4171 -> 4190 -> 4208

**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7e0td00l1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=beb3e112d1b7c7d461bb36df8a515ce6f4ce7c98

QQQ did close the same bullish abandoned baby pattern here as SPY… QQQ missed its intraday gap fill by about 9 cents. 

The daily 20ema will sit just over that 326.82 supply tomorrow and if the bears can continue to sell the markets off (which will be very hard to see QQQ drop with NVDA up 28%) then we should target that 326.82 supply. Looking here you can see we have a major demand (support) are at 325/326 and that should be a big area where we could bounce If we do see a continuation sell off. 

However, if we get a green day tomorrow we likely will see the DMI wave back up with a new demand being established at 331.32. This would lead QQQ to target 336.37 demand. I actually will look to take some longer 14-30dte calls on QQQ if we do see that play out tomorrow. 

QQQ Daily Levels  
 Supply- 337.6 -> 326.82 -> 322.31  
 Demand- 336.37 -> 325.99 -> 34.99

**VIX**

One reason I am also particularly bullish is the fact that the VIX attempted to break out over that critical 20.08 level and rejected. This rejection is a near perfect double top off the May 4th VIX candle which is when SPY put its bottom in… 

If the VIX retraces tomorrow and closes under 20.08 again then I would feel far more confident that we are going to see a bigger upside move on SPY…

The next major upside level for the VIX is 21.36 and downside level is 18.86.

NVDA - Wow! I think there’s no way it stays flat tomorrow, either below $350 or to $400.

Look at all the buzz, even the people that won their bets can’t fucking believe it. Will we see some massive profit taking tomorrow? Will we see it push higher from FOMO buyer and passive fund rebalancing? Will it lift the broader tech/AI associated sector higher? Will money flow into NDX funds and create a positive feedback loop for tech mega caps?


I threw about 25% of my portfolio at NVDS (inverse leveraged NVDA ETF) after hours at the first significant resistance level (when NVDA hit $350). But then NVDA kept on going up and NVDS kept on going down. Oh well, I think I’ll be able to break even on it, maybe I’ll sell some covered calls to counter the inverse-leveraged decay.

I sold some $13 strike 6/16 NVDS puts earlier today. Looks like I’ll be buying some more NVDS shares unless NVDA drops hard and fast, haha! IV is high right now and I’m still long term bearish on NVDA, so “wheeling” NVDS doesn’t seem too bad to me anyway.

"the NVDA and overall tech pump is no surprise to anyone who is paying attention.

The market is worried about bond prices dropping further, so they are holding off, and the only place that beats bond returns right now is high tech growth, so everyone is piling on tech - and the hype is AI - just as they did when covid hit.

Once the debt ceiling situation clears up  tech will deflate as money will move to bonds again.

At NVDA's current closing stock price of $292.13, the market is saying that Nvidia is currently the #6 most valuable listed company in the world (by market cap)... yet there are 354 listed companies that have more net earnings than NVDA, and 431 listed companies that have more revenue than NVDA.

While I have no doubt that NVDA will climb up in the earnings and revenue rankings after future earnings reports, they still have a long LONG way to go to justify being the #6 most valuable company in the world by market cap.  Orders of magnitude of company growth expectations are now already baked into the stock price of NVDA.

How does this happen?  How did we get here?

Why doesn't NVDA have competition,2023-05-18,"['NVDA', 'competition']",0.0
"This isn't really a pro/con article. Just wondering where the competition is.

The barriers of entry are certainly high. You need fabs, (or the ability to outsource it) but those are actually not that impossible to find. And even though it might take some time, there are dozens of foundries coming online in the next decade, which will help any newcomer ramp up. This is a great time to establish long-term contracts with manufacturers. Maybe even help INTC come back from utter failure. WTF happened to those cats? Remember when people didn't know if AMD would survive bankrupty because INTC was beating them senseless? Pepperidge Farm remembers.

I digress.

The reality is NVDAs greatest tool in their arsenal, that will be the main obstacle for any competitor, is their long-developed software library: numerous SDKs, CUDA, various other APIs and tools given freely to developers (even though they cost billions to develop), etc.

They use these free tools to ""help"" developers integrate WOW features into their game's way ahead of schedule (even if most people's machine/monitor can't even utilize it): DLSS, Ray Tracing, PHYSX, 3D Vision, TXAA, Lovelace, Gsync, and a bunch of other crap I can't remember.

Integrating these features into their SDKs creates a symbiotic (parasitic?) relationship where Game developers almost require consumers to own NVDA cards to have the best performance and visual quality - an ouroboros of features feeding technology - Stupidity no one needs. C'mon gang, $1500 for a video card? 

I digress, again.

These do not seem insurmountable obstacles. Sure, it will take a god-like amount of money. But there are literally 100s of billions of $ sitting in private accounts waiting to invest in something. In 2021 there were 1035 IPOS, 2022 gave us 181, and so far in 2023, a grand total of 65. I won't even discuss SPACS or Chinese nonsense stocks - smart money is over that shit.

VC & Angel investors are champing at the bit to invest in AI. And the only thing you have to show them are the margins. GG.

If this seems a hard sell - Recall a tale of a strange man who once told a bunch of billionaire investors (with a straight face) that he could simultaneously take on the car and oil industries. And he would do it by building electric cars. Electric cars that were fast and cool. All the investors had to go on was the abomination known as the GM EV1. And they gave him the $.

It takes significant time for developers to adopt new SDKs into their platforms. Especially on such a large scale in enterprise settings. Why do you think so many corporations still want to use Win2k, lol.

It's one of the primary reasons Mr. Softie has been a market leader since the day it IPO'd. Their entrenched software platform is too ubiquitous to replace. And with their insane early profits by being a DeFacto monopoly, they gobbled up every  competitor (seriously, they literally bought everything we think of as MSFT) - much of that is not comprehensively disclosed as they were still in private mode when some of their most significant purchases were made. I believe their truly most innovative application was excel, but even that was based off lotus123

The entire Windows GUI (a huge leap forward for MSFT and PC adoption, moving away from command line DOS - taken from Ventura Publisher GUI (see below image - classic!)

Winternals -bought

Halo - bought Bungie

hotmail - bought from sabeer bhatia

Powerpoint - bought from forethought

Windows toolbar - onfolio

Visio - bought from visio...

Skype - bought

Linkedin - bought

and on and on. They bought everything and everybody.

The EU/US Gov tried to break them up in the 90s, but alas, they failed ( [United States v. Microsoft Corp. - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20government%20accused%20Microsoft,such%20as%20Netscape%20and%20Java.) ).

No other company has been so dominant for so long in their industry. Even today, with all of Apple's hype, they still can't break 15% market share of PCs. And most of the people buying those machines are ""artists.""

Sorry, I digress. But I wanted to make clear I understand how powerful software barriers to entry are.

However, the same thing that makes this moat so powerful, as in the case with NVDA, is also its greatness weakness - In the end, it's just software. You hire away or capture enough engineering talent (with $), eventually you can level the playing field. Look at TSLA for a recent example. They were generations ahead of everyone. They still are, but the gap is closing and will likely reach parity in some years.

It's almost the same in every industry, especially one with nascent developments. The differential always narrows. What begins as 100s of competitors always reduces down to a handful. Consider that upon development of the automobile, there were over 2,000 automakers in the United States - That is not a typo or an exaggeration.

And if you want a more relevant example. I grew up building my own overclocked dual-Celeron gaming rigs and dreamt about owning a 3DFX video card ([https://www.pcworld.com/article/1512418/a-legendary-lost-graphics-card-just-sold-for-15000.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1512418/a-legendary-lost-graphics-card-just-sold-for-15000.html)). That was the holy grail of graphics. It was the difference between headshots and getting fragged like a noob in Doom or Quake II.

No one knew much about ATI - They had mediocre cards with absolute shit drivers but it was ok for those on a budget,

And then there was this new (older) company NVDA that was trying to get into 3d graphics. No one was sure how to pronounce the company name (""invidia"", ""eNvidia"", ""nuhvidia""?)  or why the CEO always wore leather jackets, but their cards were essentially irrelevant.

Today AMD owns ATI, 3dfx declared bankruptcy and its patents were sold to NVDA.

In just a few years, NVDA didn't just replace the market leader, it bought them out.

And they did it primarily through software.

"NVDA doesn't care about low margin IC, or even low end stand-alone GPUS anymore. Why bother?

Hell, they don't even want to build stupid $1,000 GPUs for gamers/bitcoin anymore. They are shifting their production lines to H100 for the sweet margins.

Recall, NVDA tried the low-cost integrated graphics once; they actually made their own nForce motherboards with graphics on-board. Total waste of time and money. Why bother going through the effort of making 1 billion low-cost cards when you can have a smaller footprint, produce significantly less product, and rake in so much more in profits.

INTC is dead because they have become like the OEMS they used to supply.  INTC used to make crazy money when they had no competition and fat margins. They had their engineers prance around on TV in NASA suits, and they plastered their ""intel inside"" stickers everywhere.  That was when people would gladly pay $2000-$4000 for a new pc, load up AOL, and start cybering in chat rooms.

Those days are over. PCs are now a commodity. The general population will not pay more than $1k for an entire pc or laptop.  Intc is no different than those it once served: emachines, gateway, compaq, dell, hp, etc. Computers are a commodity.

Meanwhile, NVDA has convinced people to pay up to $1600, 2x the actual value of a standard computer just for a dedicated graphics card.

you:  (according to you) NVidea intends to abandon the consumer GPU market.

Me:  doesn't care about low margin IC, or even low end stand-alone GPUS anymore - They are not abandoning the PC market - they are abandoning Integrated graphics/low-cost hardware. They are also shifting production to higher end hardware. That is not the same as abandoning their very lucrative graphics card business. Essentially, why make $50 integrated GPUS when you can make a single H100 sells for $35k+

Now, as to what's left of your points:

Apple share of pc market - 14% - essentially the top portion of income earners that are financially able to spend $2,000+ on a computer. (Average mac price $1600) Average PC price $660

The vast majority (Think World, not just US - now consider how poor the world is - think they are all about iMacs or MacBook pros?) of pcs are priced as commodities. These are simply facts you can find with askjeeves.

IF you are able to find facts that contradict my statements, I would love to hear them. Otherwise, in the style of my My Counsin Vinny:

I'm finished with this one.

Note: Phones are very 'commodizted'. you are correct. However, Apple is still managing to hold non-commodity like pricing margins. That's why they are worth nearly 3 Trillion dollars. How long will this last? I don't know.

🪵 🔥 

Ye who would hear a tale of the market's ebb and flows, heed my words and listen well. For riches come and riches go, and with them tales of heaven and hell.

Once upon a time, in the land of Btfdville, there was a bold bear. He went by Rizzly, for it seemed the markets favored his every move. He believed he had charmed the capricious
mistress of fortune, gracefully doing the tango with she who is known as the cruel mistress herself. Word of his astute short-selling abilities spread like wildfire, and soon he was the talk of the town. What also gave him hella clout was his savage remarks regarding his stock market activities.

""The only thing sweeter than honey is shorting regional bank stocks to the ground"".
""Why is it that when stocks go DOWN, my PP go UP?""
“Idk whats falling harder, the bulls' dignity, your wife's panties, the Titanic or this stock I just shorted"".

Wherever he went , ""off colour"" remarks were expressed.

At the 5 star Michelin restaurant he could now afford going to, he told the waitress: I'll take a juicy bull steak and a stock that I can mercilessly crush into oblivion, thank you. And the drink? Shareholder tears, on the rocks plz"".
At the funeral of his aunt, Mama Bear: ""This stock l'm shorting is deader than her. It'll join my aunt, Harambe, and
 FRC in the afterlife shortly. Load up on puts, trust me bro"".
At his wedding to Burry: ""I take you as my beloved spouse, to have and to hold, and to mercilessly short stocks with, until profit do us part. As we embark on this bearish journey, let us unite our portfolios and short investment thesis"".

In Rizzley's hometown of Btfdville, most ppl were chill. Being a bull was the status quo while being a bear was a no go. Rizzley always felt that this was unfair, which is why the bulls' ego he wanted to tear. Rizzley, always a contrarian at heart, wanted to break their illusion apart. He prowled the investing landscape for the most robust stock, seeking the bulls' cherished gem among the flock. Lo and behold  Nvidia,bursting with buying pressure and bullish charisma. Rizzley found his target, and set about to make the stock bleed red like Target.
He wrote various DD's on WSB, spamming the post with meteor emojis ☄️☄️☄️. Rizzley put up his short thesis flyers in various places in Btfdville, the parks, stop signs, Wendy's, even on the traffic lights' red circle 🔴 . He married his brother to the Hindenburg Research CIO. He shared his rationale to various renowned publications of his town, such as the Grizzly Gazzete, Regarded Writings and Crayon Chronicles. He even released a book, ""The Bear's Den: Where Optimism Goes to Hibernate"". In it, he was quoted as saying ""bulls are like ostriches with their heads in the sand. They refuse to see the truth. All of this Al talk is hype lol. They'll learn soon enough, the hard way hopefully"".

Convinced NVIDIA would fall, and WSB's bearish echo chamber bolstering his appetite, he went all in on NDA puts.
He sold everything he had, including himself (worked extra shifts behind Wendy's dumpster). Believing this play wouldn't go tits up, he decided to hibernate. When he will wake up, he'd be richer than Jordan Belfort in 98’. After 69 days, he rose from his slumber, first thing he did is look at Lambos and was stuck on what color. After he ordered on uber his supper (salmon seasoned with bulls' crushed hopes and dreams, the more the better), he sat at his monitor and viewed his portfolio. To his utter
dismay, NVIDIA had made a ALL TIME HIGH TODAY (currently at $295.47). His portfolio was shredded , pain in his heart now embedded. His puts now nearly worthless, shattered the bear who was once fearless. He didn't know what to say, think, or do, only managed a GUH as ControltheNarrative did too.
He eventually regained some composure, and begged the market for this to be over. When he shouted ""THIS ISNT FAIR"", that’s his mans, Burry, walked in, ""Honey, your salmon
is here, seasoned perfectly to our liking, tonight, we shall feast like vikings.” With tears streaming down his face, Rizzly knew that he had just lost their place 🏡. The monitor, with one hand he tried to cover, and with the other halt his mate's enter. However, it was too late. Burry saw the look on Rizzly's face and[knew of their fate.](https://i.postimg.cc/WzZRfDhR/092-D691-D-7-CEC-4-BB2-9243-DF297382-DF94.jpg)

Alas, my fellow regards, he was never a bear, but an ostrich with too much flair.
And I, what positions do I hold? Why 30 NVIDIA 285p's of course, all told.

The first one was made before the earnings data (1:38 PM PDT (California time)). NVDA earnings release was at 2:00 PM

In theory is a bullish tweet if you assume that he loves his dog. But algos (AI) may have interpreted it like ""NVDA is like a dog"" so it will ""underperform"".

Maybe that sparked a signal on the algos and they started to bid NVDA shares helping to drive it to ATHs (I bet advanced algos support the inverseCramer signal)

Some hours later Cramer started tweeting clearly unambiguous bullish tweets about NVDA. The thing is that he tweeted those after trading was closed. After hours trading ends at 8:00 PM ET (which is 5:00 PM PDT) and he did that tweet at 5:13 PM PDT

Okay, I love NVDA and I've been trading it up and down last couple of weeks for either short swings, or just intraday momentum plays. I say this to explain that I am somewhat used to staring at the behavior of this chart since I stare at it frequently for hours.

NVDA in the previous two weeks had done 2 round trips from put wall to call wall. I bought these calls right at the hedge wall for nvda at 205 on Tuesday (I think it was just above that price when I bought in). The putwall (highest concentration of puts) was at 200. So hedgewalls are where market makers are delta neutral in options positioning and thus that seems like a good place to get an entry. The second thing I noticed was that there was a compression in the Gamma ratio (16% compression) with the put wall coming up and call wall moving up (which is a bullish indicator). Gamma ratio compression in 2 digits is rare as it is an overall ratio for PutGamma/CallGamma. This again indicated that there was more magnetism to the upside if we did move up on earnings.

Overall this was still a punt (as in all earnings plays are punts), but it was an educated punt based on what I just explained and previous answers upthread.",2023-02-25,"['free', 'trial', 'fit', 'need', 'disclosure', 'beta', 'user', 'think', 'highly', 'product', 'use', 'daily', 'signal', 'need', 'help', 'sense', 'option', 'market', 'okay', 'love', 'NVDA', 'trade', 'couple', 'week', 'short', 'swing', 'intraday', 'momentum', 'play', 'explain', 'somewhat', 'stare', 'behavior', 'chart', 'stare', 'frequently', 'hour', 'NVDA', 'previous', 'week', 'round', 'trip', 'wall', 'wall', 'buy', 'call', 'right', 'hedge', 'wall', 'nvda', 'Tuesday', 'think', 'price', 'buy', 'putwall', 'high', 'concentration', 'put', 'hedgewall', 'market', 'maker', 'delta', 'neutral', 'option', 'positioning', 'like', 'good', 'place', 'entry', 'second', 'thing', 'notice', 'compression', 'Gamma', 'ratio', 'compression', 'wall', 'come', 'wall', 'move', 'bullish', 'indicator', 'gamma', 'ratio', 'compression', 'digit', 'rare', 'overall', 'ratio', 'PutGamma', 'CallGamma', 'indicate', 'magnetism', 'upside', 'earning', 'overall', 'punt', 'earning', 'play', 'punt', 'educate', 'punt', 'base', 'explain', 'previous', 'answer', 'upthread']",0.11433583959899751
"Thanks a lot for the info. I'll start a trial.  I'm really hoping they have a ""gamma heatmap"" -- eg, showing how much gamma there is at each price point (as opposed to just which price point is the peak).

I'm a bit confused about ""hedgewalls"" meaning dealers are delta neutral. Shouldn't they only be delta neutral at one price point? How can it be the case that they are delta neutral at both the callwall and putwall?

I'm also confused about ""gamma ratio"". From the description it's a measurement of how much gamma comes from puts vs calls... but I'm not sure how a positive ratio implies magnetism to the upside. As I see it, gamma works both ways -- it just makes price more slippery.  If stock moves up, shares bought to hedge calls, shares bought to dehedge puts.  If stock moves down, shares sold to dehedge calls, shares sold to hedge puts.

How can this be legal to do? $NVDA,2023-02-28,"['legal', 'NVDA']",0.2
I will start this off by saying I'm short $NVDA so the mixed shelf actually helps my position. But isn't the   SEC allowing them to do a 10 billion mixed shelf setting a really bad precedence. What's to stop a CEO/CFO that gets stock options in the future from announcing a 15 billion buyback since buybacks don't have a time frame it doesn't matter how long it takes them to complete it say this in itself causes the stock to pump 20%. Then they start to do a very small portion of the buyback say 3 billion over 2 quarters which at an average of 150 per share is around 20 million shares and reporting those buybacks along with pumping causes another 25% raise you're now up 45% in 180 days. After those 180 day and being up 45% you do a mixed shelf for say 10 billion and with the increased priced you selling at an average of 200 now increasing the shares buy 50 million. So from the start you now have increased the outstanding shares by 30 million with raising 6 billion in capital. Well this announcement and selling the shares will cause the price to fall say 15% to around $180. Now with the price falling and still having to buy back 12 billion worth you wait for the next quarter to start buying back again slowly so you don't trigger the price to increase and buy back 1 billion at and average of 166 taking back 6 million shares. Total increase is now 24 million shares. Say your price falls all the way back to years low at $100 and you do a very large buyback that quarter of $6 billion at an average of around $115 buying back 52 million shares. Now you've decreased your share count by 28 million shares from the start and it hasn't cost you a dime because everything was from the mixed shelf. Now you only have to buyback 5 billion from the original announcement. Well while all of this was going on you have been getting stock options so say you owned 8% of the company from the start with buying the shares back it's now increased your position to 10% without having to risk anything on your part. Isn't this just as bad as someone pumping a stock to just dump it on other people? It's basically a very large pump and dump. This is all especially since all the insider selling the last month going on. This sounds to me like it's just a lawsuit waiting to happen. Next thing you know is they are going to let the price drop so everyone who sold shares can buy them back for cheaper just to turn around and cancel the mixed shelf.,2023-02-28,"['start', 'say', 'short', 'NVDA', 'mixed', 'shelf', 'actually', 'help', 'position', 'SEC', 'allow', 'billion', 'mixed', 'shelf', 'set', 'bad', 'precedence', 'stop', 'CEO', 'CFO', 'get', 'stock', 'option', 'future', 'announce', 'billion', 'buyback', 'buyback', 'time', 'frame', 'matter', 'long', 'take', 'complete', 'cause', 'stock', 'pump', 'start', 'small', 'portion', 'buyback', 'billion', 'quarter', 'average', 'share', 'million', 'share', 'report', 'buyback', 'pumping', 'cause', 'raise', 'day', 'day', 'mixed', 'shelf', 'billion', 'increase', 'price', 'sell', 'average', 'increase', 'share', 'buy', 'million', 'start', 'increase', 'outstanding', 'share', 'million', 'raise', 'billion', 'capital', 'announcement', 'sell', 'share', 'cause', 'price', 'fall', 'price', 'fall', 'have', 'buy', 'billion', 'worth', 'wait', 'quarter', 'start', 'buy', 'slowly', 'trigger', 'price', 'increase', 'buy', 'billion', 'average', 'take', 'million', 'share', 'total', 'increase', 'million', 'share', 'price', 'fall', 'way', 'year', 'low', 'large', 'buyback', 'quarter', 'billion', 'average', 'buy', 'million', 'share', 'decrease', 'share', 'count', 'million', 'share', 'start', 'cost', 'dime', 'mixed', 'shelf', 'buyback', 'billion', 'original', 'announcement', 'go', 'get', 'stock', 'option', 'own', 'company', 'start', 'buy', 'share', 'increase', 'position', 'have', 'risk', 'bad', 'pump', 'stock', 'dump', 'people', 'basically', 'large', 'pump', 'dump', 'especially', 'insider', 'sell', 'month', 'go', 'sound', 'like', 'lawsuit', 'wait', 'happen', 'thing', 'know', 'go', 'let', 'price', 'drop', 'sell', 'share', 'buy', 'cheap', 'turn', 'cancel', 'mixed', 'shelf']",0.013452380952380964

"My guy it’s kinda how the game is played. Also your over thinking it. If the stock is overvalued, the insiders have been dumping decent amounts for over a month and it pumped on trash earnings, and economic and political climate are very tenuous why wouldn’t they pump on crap earnings only to sell into dilution. 

It’s not necessarily just the executives creating cash, it’s also potentially a lot of holders selling right before a potential decline over a the next few months. 

Either way I’m leveraged to the downside cuz this POS ain’t worth it’s valuation and it’s earnings call was trash.

🚀🌕 NVDA: Crypto Slump Ain't Holding Us Back – Gaming Revenues Ready to Blast Off! 💥🎮,2023-03-19,"['NVDA', 'Crypto', 'Slump', 'ai', 'hold', 'Gaming', 'Revenues', 'ready', 'blast']",0.2
"Greetings, fellow degenerates! Buckle up, because it's time to talk about a stock that's primed for some explosive gains. 

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), the unstoppable GPU powerhouse that's about to see gaming revenues skyrocket, despite the hurting crypto industry.

Crypto Who? 🤔
While it's true that NVIDIA has dipped its toes into the crypto waters with their Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) product line, don't let the current crypto slump fool you. In Q1 2021, CMP sales accounted for only $155 million, about 2.74% of NVIDIA's total revenue of $5.66 billion. That's peanuts compared to their gaming segment, which brought in a whopping $2.76 billion or 49% of the total revenue. So even if the crypto industry takes a hit, NVDA's bottom line remains resilient, and they're ready to dominate the gaming market.

Gaming Revenues: Ready for Lift-off 🚀
In the past five years, NVIDIA has seen a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20%, and with a new generation of gaming consoles and blockbuster games hitting the shelves, the demand for high-performance GPUs is about to skyrocket. NVIDIA's GeForce GPUs are gamers' top choice, and we all know that the gaming market is booming. Global gaming industry revenue is projected to reach $196 billion by 2022, up from $159.3 billion in 2020. As more people turn to gaming for entertainment, NVIDIA is poised to reap the rewards, translating into juicy gains for us degenerate apes.

Cloud Gaming: The Next Frontier 🌌
Cloud gaming is gaining traction, and NVIDIA is already ahead of the game with its GeForce NOW platform. The cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48.2% from 2021 to 2028, reaching $7.24 billion by 2028. As more gamers shift to cloud gaming, NVIDIA's gaming revenues will further soar, making the crypto industry's struggles look like a minor speed bump on the road to the moon.

So, fellow degenerates, strap in and prepare for takeoff, because NVDA is ready to show the world that the gaming industry's gains will overshadow any crypto woes. Remember, this ain't financial advice, and always do your own research. But don't be surprised if we're all partying on the moon with our sweet, sweet NVDA tendies. 🌕🍗",2023-03-19,"['greeting', 'fellow', 'degenerate', 'buckle', 'time', 'talk', 'stock', 'prime', 'explosive', 'gain', 'NVIDIA', 'NASDAQ', 'NVDA', 'unstoppable', 'GPU', 'powerhouse', 'gaming', 'revenue', 'skyrocket', 'despite', 'hurt', 'crypto', 'industry', 'Crypto', 'true', 'NVIDIA', 'dip', 'toe', 'crypto', 'water', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Mining', 'Processor', 'CMP', 'product', 'line', 'let', 'current', 'crypto', 'slump', 'fool', 'CMP', 'sale', 'account', 'million', 'NVIDIA', 'total', 'revenue', 'billion', 'peanut', 'compare', 'gaming', 'segment', 'bring', 'whopping', 'billion', 'total', 'revenue', 'crypto', 'industry', 'take', 'hit', 'NVDA', 'line', 'remain', 'resilient', 'ready', 'dominate', 'gaming', 'market', 'Gaming', 'Revenues', 'ready', 'Lift', 'past', 'year', 'NVIDIA', 'see', 'compound', 'annual', 'growth', 'rate', 'CAGR', 'new', 'generation', 'gaming', 'console', 'blockbuster', 'game', 'hit', 'shelf', 'demand', 'high', 'performance', 'gpu', 'skyrocket', 'NVIDIA', 'GeForce', 'gpu', 'gamer', 'choice', 'know', 'gaming', 'market', 'boom', 'global', 'gaming', 'industry', 'revenue', 'project', 'reach', 'billion', 'billion', 'people', 'turn', 'gaming', 'entertainment', 'NVIDIA', 'poise', 'reap', 'reward', 'translate', 'juicy', 'gain', 'degenerate', 'ape', 'Cloud', 'Gaming', 'Frontier', 'Cloud', 'gaming', 'gain', 'traction', 'NVIDIA', 'ahead', 'game', 'GeForce', 'platform', 'cloud', 'gaming', 'market', 'expect', 'grow', 'CAGR', 'reach', 'billion', 'gamer', 'shift', 'cloud', 'gaming', 'NVIDIA', 'gaming', 'revenue', 'soar', 'make', 'crypto', 'industry', 'struggle', 'look', 'like', 'minor', 'speed', 'bump', 'road', 'moon', 'fellow', 'degenerate', 'strap', 'prepare', 'takeoff', 'NVDA', 'ready', 'world', 'gaming', 'industry', 'gain', 'overshadow', 'crypto', 'woe', 'remember', 'be', 'financial', 'advice', 'research', 'surprised', 'partying', 'moon', 'sweet', 'sweet', 'NVDA', 'tendie']",0.052575757575757574

"Chat GPT is great and is a game changer but its not going to change the fact that the PC market is drastically slowing, so is crypto(miners). Its also not going to solve all the worlds problems. If anything its going to put alot of people out of work.  The expectation that all these AI companies will somehow needs alot of new chips doesnt make sense. The services are live now and everyone that needed chips to launch their bots(Chat GPT; Google; Microsoft etc) already have what they need. This reminds me of the time when everyone thought broadband was going to be huge and super expensive. Same hype was around crypto. This is just another boom cycle. The time to buy NVDA was 3 months ago.

Also there is still AI regulation and laws to be created. If you think AI will write your resume, cover letter, college essay or do your work for you, it wont. Restrictions are coming.

 **EDIT:**

7.5k x 1.37 x (187-172.5) = 150k CAD down so far!

Max pain is $160 rn, so MMs might manipulate the stock price lower so they don't have to pay out. Usually, my brokerage doesn't liquidate me right away, so I will hold my short if they don't.

Also, I'm running long/short on account #1 so that may minimize the blow! Let's see what happens.

Sometimes you gotta think in opposites in the market to make money.

Which one would you buy the dip? $NVDA VS $AMD,2022-12-21,"['buy', 'dip', 'NVDA', 'VS', 'AMD']",0.0
"Who’s better? $NVDA VS $AMD

$NVDA and $AMD stocks are down 60% in the last year. Is it a good time to invest or too dangerous?

$NVDA started off making chips for video games and now is leading with high-performance GPUs for PC gaming, augmented virtualization, and data centers. Also, getting into new projects with their AI, powering the metaverse, creating EARTH 2 (helping predict climate change), data centers, and simulators in the AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES industry (with clients from $MBG.DEDE to $NIO).

$AMD similar to $NVDA is a semiconductor company that operated in the computing and graphics segments. Some of $AMD's main projects are, Google Cloud Confidential Computing, advancing data centers, discoveries on mars, and the advance of AI getting into smart homes and autonomous vehicles. Also, $AMD recently acquired Xilinx to tap the high-performance and adaptive computing opportunity.

At the height of the pandemic, semiconductors stocks witnessed a high demand and growth, with everyone upgrading the devices while staying at home, making three years of sales in two.

Now worldwide PC shipments reported their steepest-ever decline of 19.5% year-over-year in the third quarter. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa reported the sharpest dip of 26.4%.

Many businesses lowered their technology spending due to geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

Which one would you buy the dip?

* $AMD has a market cap of 104B and $16.434B revenue with a Revenue YoY Quarterly Growth of 29%.
* $NVDA has a market cap of 400B and $26.914B revenue with a Revenue YoY Quarterly Growth of 16.5%
* Debt/ Equity ratio of $NVDA is 0.492 compared to $AMD 0.053
* Price to FCF of $AMD 27.635, $NVDA is 83.393
* $NVDA P/S is 14.066 compared to $AMD 4.139

$AMD like $NVDA has a lot of similarities and will probably benefit a lot from its work with open AI and autonomous vehicles. $NVDA has an advantage in GPUs for PC gaming but $AMD has a diverse product portfolio of CPU, SoC, FPGA, and GPU.

Looking at its financials, projects, and company history I would invest in $AMD.

What would you invest in?

"First off, I am aware that NVDA literally got cut in half YTD.
So, on average, shorting it throughout 2022 has been a massively profitable undertaking and ""the time to buy puts was exactly 1 year ago"".

With those snarky comments out of the way, NVDA is still sitting on a PE of ~62 and forward PE of ~38.

That seems way too high in the current macroeconomic environment.

* Fed isn't done raising rates yet. We are yet to reach the terminal rate and they have been clear in wanting to keep it there for a while.
* Rates take some time to work through the real economy. I do think we haven't seen the pain JPOW spoke of, at least in the real economy.
* There's been real and heavy gamer backlash against the 4000 series GPUs when prices were revealed. Gamers genuinely think NVDA has lost the plot and think they can charge whichever price.
* Coupled with the end of GPU crypto mining, the market is likely flooded with cheap and still very high performance 3000 series GPUs, not generating any new revenue for NVDA.
* Their GPUs are used for state of the art AI projects in other companies. I'm far from an expert but those are expensive projects and could easily be perceived as ""not  essential in these trying times"" making said companies pause these projects, reducing yet again demand for NVDA's GPUs.



As I said, yes the stock has lost 50% in 2022 so some of the above has definitely been priced in.
**What is going to drive demand for their products in such a way that they meet revenue and EPS targets? Let alone allow them to give upbeat guidance?** 



***Positions***: none so far, thinking about throwing a few grand into longer dated puts.

Calling all devil advocates to come up with a bullish reasoning to spark discussion and gauge if the ship has sailed for this dumb gamble or the bearish reasoning does hold merit and is an educated guess that should net profits.

Have a great NY and may our portfolios be green in 2023.

"I hold puts on NVDA. And buy more puts on each bear market rally. So, obviously biased, but here's an important point you did not mention.

Data center sales for expensive GPUs is a very lagging indicator. These GPUs are great, essential for ML training workloads and nVidia has a monopolistic position in the market. Their APIs and frameworks are unmatched, although Intel and AMD are slowly creeping in.

Everyone will tell you how great data center sales are, how they are growing and that this matters the most, and thus you can ignore poor retail sales.

However, data center sales by large cloud providers are planned at least a year ahead. I'm talking about AWS, AZURE, and GCP.

When the pandemic hit, large clouds were caught off guard and did not have enough capacity to meet the demand. As everyone else in the economy, they over reacted and over provisioned. Chip shortage made situation much worse, as they couldn't fullfil their orders for a year.

Now, those orders are coming in and the demand isn't there anymore. Again, like everyone else, large clouds now have more capacity than there's demand in the market. 

And all tech CEOs are confident recession is coming. They all almost froze hiring, many top companies went through at least one round of layoffs, reduced budgets, spending and capital investments. Cost optimizations are everywhere.

And what those large clouds will cut first when they believe recession is around the corner, and they are already over provisioned and expect demand to fall further? New and expensive chips will be the first to go.

As tech over reacted on the up side they will now over react on the down side. Nvidia sales reflect orders from 2020-2021, that's like housing demand from May 2021. Those sales have already cratered, but are not reflected in the quarterly reports yet. Once they do you will see a sharp drop, surprised analytics, huge earnings miss and confused dip buyers.

Once everyone starts talking how bad data centers sales are, I'll close my puts.

For nvidia to become a buy again I'll need to see some leaks about their new generation of chips with better cost/efficiency ratio. This is what market wants and nvidia can't deliver. 

Currently nvidia is trapped overpaying for the best TSMC node to produce expensive energy hungry products with falling demand.

I firmly disagree on companies cutting their ML development in a deteriorating environment; for many companies, strong ML IS the economic future of their company. 

NVDA stays high because as much as things could possibly deteriorate in the short term, in the mid to long term, NVDA makes one of the most critical products for the advancement of technology. When it dips, people will buy it, and at some point, we’re going to get a bullish tech market again and the shares will achieve an even greater premium. Their growth prospects in the ~10 year span are better than most mega cap companies, yet they are also one of the safest growth investments out there.

On CPI day, $NVDA hit \~188. My avg for my short position was around $172.5.

I had \~7200 shares short total. 

7200 x (188-172.5) x 1.37 (USD to CAD conversion) = \~**150k CAD in the RED**

I lost around 1200 shares to margin calls which meant \~10k CAD total loss.

Cathie Wood just unloaded her NVDA shares ahead of Q3 earnings report. 52 week low for NVDA was 108 this year. I guess she expects them to drop significantly and will likely rebuy shares after earnings or wait longer until market crashes. This is a great opportunity to buy puts.

"I have to agree with Cathie here.  Nvidia is heading into tough economic conditions where they are selling gas guzzling Lambos and everyone wants fuel efficient Teslas.

AMD's Navi 31 is the first step into chiplet based GPU's.  AMD has been doing it for years now with  Zen  and I would imagine they now have the ability to take the performance crown away from Nvidia in the next generation (or sooner if they respin the Navi 31 silicon).

7900 XTX is within 15% of the 4090 based on preliminary benchmarks.  The 4090 is also priced 60% higher than the 7900 XTX ($1,600 vs $999) and the 4080 is priced 20% more than the 7900 XTX ($1,200 vs $999).  In short I don't believe Nvidia can hold their prices long term if they expect the same volumes as the last generation which included massive crypto mining.

Almost all of my losses came from being \~max margin short $NVDA during earnings (last earnings, not this one), and being \~max margin long during $ASTS earnings.

I've coped with these losses decently well I would like to think. I'm still up a ton from where I started (\~70k), but it kind of sucks not being a millionaire anymore. I used to pay the bill every time my friends and I would go out to eat, tip big, get haircuts often, eat out every single meal of the day (and be able to afford extra meat lol), etc. I don't feel secure doing that right now. It felt really good not having to worry about money.

The worst out of all this is that I promised my parents I would buy them a house, and I can no longer do that. Houses are 1.5m+ in my area, and at one point I could have literally bought it in cash. Instead, I gambled it all away. They were dejected but I can't go back to the past and change what happened. They'll have to live in a shitty apartment unfortunately until I can figure things out again.  

Let's look at the bright side (coping mechanism😔):

1. I made these mistakes at 22. I still have time to recover from losses (hopefully)
2. I already took out and spent \~150k buying my parent's cars, paying off their debts, and spending money on myself before I lost most the money
3. I haven't lost everything. Almost everything, but not everything.
4. I couldn't sleep at night with my extremely leveraged portfolio. I feel as if a weight has been taken off my back.
5. I am still alive, and healthy. We don't need much money nowadays to get our basic needs met. We don't need much money to be happy.

At the end of the day, I'm still thankful for everything I've been blessed with. I have clean water, food on the table, and a roof over my head. Sure, you need to strive and work towards greater heights, but you still need to appreciate what you have.

Lessons/Mistakes:

1. We underestimate tail risks (even if you know that you underestimate tail risks), and we underestimate how losses (and wins) can trigger a feedback loop of possibly portfolio-ending decisions (I literally wrote this on my last post before I lost my money, but I ended up losing it anyways😓)
2. The market is not rational. It doesn't care about your squiggly (or straight) lines or your discounted cash flow analysis (at least right away). Position yourself accordingly.
3. Have other things to do other than watching the market. I was researching/watching the market 10 hours+ a day some days. I stopped going to the gym. I stopped going to my classes. Etc. Just to watch the market and find some sort of alpha online. Being too active made me consistently switch my positions up, and made me unable to sit on my hands.
4. Position sizing. I would go all in on a single stock a lot of the time. Using margin as well.
5. Using margin. I was using maximum margin ever since I started investing/trading. I'm surprised I didn't get wiped a whole lot earlier. When you use max margin, you are forced to sell at the worst prices, and volatility drag occurs.
6. Shorting on max margin. This was pretty fking regarded, but it's what made me most of my money. When you short, you can only make a maximum of 100% but your risks are unlimited. Not an asymmetrical bet you'd want to take often imo.
7. Next time around, if I do ""short"", I would need to either do it using puts or be short stock with calls as hedges.
8. All or nothing mentality. Even when I already made it. This was pretty regarded as well. I could have gone all in on dividend stocks and never had to work a day in my life. But I didn't do that.
9. Probs a million other things

I relapsed in 2005 during a divorce and went to prison in 2008. I lost the last quarter of my 20s, several years of my life, all my money, everyone forgot about me, and I felt like my life was over.

I was 31 when I got out, and I had $800 to my name. It took my several years to rebuild, but I did. I not only rebuilt, but I rebuilt to levels well beyond where I was in my 20s. In the end though, what I am grateful for every day is the fact that I have a roof over my head, food to eat, and my freedom.

"TLDR: NVDA will likely beat the low-ball $5.9B and raise guidance for next quarter easily... 

4090 GPUs are selling in hot demand after absolutely shattering the gaming records set by the 3090 last year at the same price point. The selling prices right now are >$2200, above the $1600 MSRP and are currently unavailable for purchase anywhere for less than $2200. Furthermore from source [1], the 4090 was retailing at around $2000 US in the Asian markets but since launch, the price has started to hike up and currently sits at around $3000 US. At the same time, the demand for NVIDIA's H100 GPUs has shot up due to the upcoming China ban. The H100 PCIe accelerator which was available for $11,000 US is now selling for over $33,000$. The SXM version of the same GPU sells for even more but is much harder to come by. 

Although NVIDIA has suspended sales of their high-end AI GPUs in China, they have up till September 2023 to fulfill all current orders. Nvidia says that they are applying for export licenses for non-military use in China. The NVIDIA Hopper H100 GPUs can also be supplied through Hong Kong before 1st September 2023 so it looks like there's at least 1 year of time given to customers to finalize their orders with NVIDIA. Nvidia said it had booked $400 million in sales (~10% of total datacenter sales from China) of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products. It said it plans to apply for exemptions to the rule.

>If GPU prices go up however, this potential lost booking might not be as bad as people think. It could actually prove to be a tailwind.

>People also don't realize that the 4090 absolutely destroys AI workloads (just not to the same scale as H100 due to the lack of NVlink) from [3]. I suspect a chunk of AI chip demand will come from mid-scale enterprise (not hyperscalers) scooping up 4090s going forward after the Sept 2023 ban. 

NVIDIA Clean Sweeps MLPerf AI Benchmarks With Hopper H100 GPU, Up To 4.5x Performance Uplift Over Ampere A100. Biren [2] chips were a strong competitor of Ampere but now they are banned from using any advanced node unless they get export licenses. Where will China get their AI chips after Sept 2023? This will make GPU prices incredibly elevated for at least the next year. 

There are geopolitical risks but these risks are in some ways good for Nvidia in the long term. The upcoming recession is causing trouble for AI chip companies as this industry is very winner-takes-all (ask AMD). The china ban got rid of Nvidia's main competition from Biren and Huawei. I was bearish on Nvidia short term due to China, but after the recent hot 4090 and H100 demand and the 4090 benchmarks, I am bullish on NVDA.

"I just bought parts to build a new computer yesterday. A new 3060 ti for $450 is what I went with. I have plenty of money, but I can't justify spending more than ~$800+ on a GPU. I think the prices are insane for Nvidia's cards and think they shot themselves in the foot. A 3060 ti is usually more than enough for 99% of games at 1080p, which is what most people are still on. 

I'll be surprised if they beat earnings. Very few people are buying 4090 GPUs, and people overall have less disposable income. 

The only CPU/GPU company I think we will see clearly beat earnings is Intel. Their new 13th generation CPUs are arguably better for most use cases than AMD chips, and they cost quite a bit less than the AMD chips competing at each price point. 

Also, apparently Intel Arc GPUs are selling fairly well, based on rumors. 

I'm biased against Nvidia right now though. They took advantage of the market when crypto was still gobbling up GPUs. Then the CEO says that ""Moore's law is dead"" to try to justify their 4000 series price gouging while they hold back lower tier 4000 series cards.

For the record, yes I have ""bags"".  I also made a nice load of money from 2017 to 2021 from mining and sold for a profit.  I have been mining since 2011.

As of right now, mining is ""dead"" and has zero impact on the pricing of cards and has not since Ethereum swapped to proof of stake.  Unless you have free electricity right now, everything is mined at a loss that has NOTHING to do with 4000s/3000s/2000s or whatever other bullshit you want to believe from nvidia.

I was making profit all day on 3060 12gb and 3070.  Easy 40-50Mhs on 50% power draw. $0.10 kwh.

You really have not researched anything and your echochamber wherever you hang out is not research.  Look around more, son.

Take a breath and realize some people know more than you do.  There are a shitload of people that know WAY more than I do.

Why do stocks go up?  


Why do stocks go down?  


Please someone come and educate me on why the fuck a company that has made record profits in the past several years due to the huge explosion and adoption of cryptocurrency and POW mining is going to continue to do so when POW mining no longer exists.  


Can someone smarter than myself please educate me on how the fuck a company like NVDA releasing a new 40 series paperweight that barely competes with the 30 series paperweights that are all flooding the secondary market are going to sell this shit?  


No-one is buying the fucking 40 series GPU, they wont... When you can get a 3080 or 3090 that's highly competitive for a fraction of the cost, the entire GPU market is going to be going second hand over the next several years and companies like NVDA are going to get assblasted more than anyone else.  


If you are betting on NVDA, you are betting in the wrong direction..

"Incorrect.  


If you quickly google what to mine you can see its a zero sum game, everytime a coin is profitable there is so much wandering hashrate available that it instantly nukes a coin into the unprofitable area.  


For example the entire POW hashrate was lets say 100 hashes (fake metric)  
This includes the incredible ETH coin that is worth $1400 + USD.  
Lets say 70 hashes are on ETH and the rest are on all the other POW coins.  


Once ETH stopped being POW the 70 hashes flooded to all the other coins and made them completely unprofitable and no longer useful to mine.  


There is no correlation between hash power and coin price, these coins are only supported in terms of functional hashrate right now by people who are losing money to support them by running their algo's.  


Head on over to ANY of the ethmining / gpu mining subreddits any of the mining calculators and you can quickly see that we suddenly have a massive excess hashrate because the 70 hashes that were being provided for ETH miners suddenly dont exist.  


Or some rough explanation like that, the basic concept is that there will be no Proof of work coin worth mining in the next 2+ years.

$NVDA trade recap,2022-11-16,"['NVDA', 'trade', 'recap']",0.0
"$NVDA stock The stock was on my pre-market watch list. The market started falling and so did NVDA, my plan was to enter the stock short as soon as it reaches the $163.3 resistance level and take a target at $159.5 which is the area of yesterday's daily low. 

Entry point - $162.29 

Stop Loss - $163.65 (above the daily high) 

Add - $160.52 

Take profit point - $159.7  

In my opinion, excellent trade with proper risk management and pushing forward as soon as I had confirmation that the movement of the stock and the market are in a downward direction, sticking to my trading plan.

NVDA Earnings Play (11/16/2022),2022-11-11,"['NVDA', 'Earnings', 'play']",0.0
" Hi everyone,

I am thinking of shorting NVDA ahead of their earnings next week. Although I think in the long term NVDA is a great stock, I think their upcoming earnings will not meet expectations. My reasons are:

\- Not nearly as much hype for their newly released 40 series GPU cards compared to their 30 series.

\- Supply issues during their 30 series release and insanely high prices distanced many people from even thinking about buying an NVIDIA GPU card.

\- China lockdowns and economic troubles, in addition to recent US chip industry sanctions might have affected their AI/cloud business over there.

The only reason I have some trepidation about shorting NVDA is that they might come up with a positive guidance for future quarter earnings.

What do y'all think? Anyone else got an earnings-related play in mind?

Edit: I forgot that Microsoft reported good revenue in their Azure/cloud business, of which NVDA is a partner. If NVDA is popping off in that sector then maybe investors might see a silver lining and not care much if gaming is underperforming.",2022-11-11,"['hi', 'think', 'short', 'NVDA', 'ahead', 'earning', 'week', 'think', 'long', 'term', 'NVDA', 'great', 'stock', 'think', 'upcoming', 'earning', 'meet', 'expectation', 'reason', 'nearly', 'hype', 'newly', 'release', 'series', 'GPU', 'card', 'compare', 'series', 'Supply', 'issue', 'series', 'release', 'insanely', 'high', 'price', 'distance', 'people', 'think', 'buy', 'NVIDIA', 'GPU', 'card', 'China', 'lockdown', 'economic', 'trouble', 'addition', 'recent', 'chip', 'industry', 'sanction', 'affect', 'AI', 'cloud', 'business', 'reason', 'trepidation', 'short', 'NVDA', 'come', 'positive', 'guidance', 'future', 'quarter', 'earning', 'think', 'get', 'earning', 'relate', 'play', 'mind', 'edit', 'forget', 'Microsoft', 'report', 'good', 'revenue', 'Azure', 'cloud', 'business', 'NVDA', 'partner', 'NVDA', 'pop', 'sector', 'maybe', 'investor', 'silver', 'lining', 'care', 'gaming', 'underperforming']",0.1595104895104895

$NVDA might need to recall their new 4090 GPUs,2022-10-31,"['NVDA', 'need', 'recall', 'new', 'gpu']",0.13636363636363635
"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.

More importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.

Anyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.

"$NVDA used crypto mining money finished some good shit during this covid years, they have a computer system of their own, CPU + GPU integrated, then buidl nvlink of ARM CPU,

&#x200B;

I think they did not use the mining money for nothing, they actually start dominating computing world.

&#x200B;

Look at INtel, they did not make any good money, and they did nothing for their development, I mean x86 has to give up , right,

&#x200B;

Govertment forbid $nvda selling equipment to CHINA, they have to subsidize, like boosting defend spending on unmanned veheicile.

&#x200B;

My monkey brain does not what NVDA can do, but maybe someone smart can figure out a big economical problem can be solved with lots of nvda chips.

&#x200B;

It is so hard to disrupt $NVDA.

&#x200B;

if you build AI solution that need 2 million dollar equipment per year, but can hire 20 less employee, every business wnat to do it.

&#x200B;

maybe $NVDA is so advanced that it will never solve a cosumer problem like iPhone does, just a prestine tech commany, but not making economical sense,

"Congress is taking a vote next week on subsidizing semi conductor producers. If the vote passes stocks go up if the vote doesn’t pass stocks will go down because everyone is going to sell their bets. 

Nanci’s husband has already bought a ton of NVDA stock. That means that the vote will most likely pass. 

Now this is some crystal clear shit. Any boomer looking at the news can see this this trade which means that we will probably see a gap up on Monday for NVDA. 

However a lot of traders especially retirement fund institutions will probably wait until the vote comes through to buy into this stock which means that we aren’t technically too late to the party.

"Nvda isn't looking great in the short term.

The crypto crash is seeing bulk liquidations of mining gpus, crashing the prices. 

The board makers have huge inventories and basically said ""were not making your new cards until our old ones are gone."" threats did not work. Heavy discounts are likely and nvidia will likely have to wear a lot of it. 

They locked in a bunch of tsmc fab time/units they asked nicely not to use/pay for and tsmc said ""ok find someone to buy it from you and we'll talk"". 

So in the near future, the last 2 years of sales to miners, a market that has gone into liquidation, will see the new products competing with a flood of heavily discounted old stock. The lower end chips will be a hard sell. Why buy a 4060 when a 3080 is cheaper and faster?

The stock broke a downtrend line today, the stock was not on my pre-market watch list but I noticed it during the day. After the stock broke the trend line I waited for it to come back to test it as a resistance level and I recognized that a descending trend line had formed that could be used as an additional resistance level that would give me an excellent **RRR**.

"“Imagine for a moment that you decided to invest money now and you bought a farm,” said Buffett, the chairman and CEO Berkshire Hathaway. “Let's say you bought 160 acres...and the farmer next to you had 160 identical acres, same contour, same soil quality.”

Now, imagine that the farmer who has the same farm as yours makes you an offer every day to either sell his farm to you or buy yours, he continued.

“That's a very obliging neighbor,” Buffett said.

This pricing advantage is something you don’t get with farms, but you get with stocks, according to Buffett.

Buying stocks — like buying a farm — means you’re buying into a business. But with stocks, you have an added advantage of having that neighbor — or other investors — giving you a price for your farm every day.

“The only thing you have to do is remember that this guy next door is there to serve you and not to instruct you,” Buffett said. “You bought the farm because you thought the farm had the potential. You don’t need a quote on it.”

Moves: Yesterday before close, I got rid of the DKNG shares and bought back my calls, sold the 285 NVDA puts and put all the $ into 290 NVDA Puts (safer...) LOL.

I was planning on selling all these today mid day for about $45k profit overall and avoid the dice roll of CPI tomorrow pre market, but decided the WSB gods would be disappointed.

Instead, I held, down about $9k overall since opening the position/my previous post.

So here u go. Still holding and tomorrow premarket will make or break this regards life savings for the 500th time in the last couple years. Enjoy the anticipation and anxiety while I sleep like a baby knowing Theta gang can lick my huge balls. Oh and F*ck ur calls!

That's it. That's all you need, one giant picture and a stock recommendation. But if you want a little bit more here ya go.   


  


[Haha, dum bers](https://preview.redd.it/27oqvqb4e52b1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c5275a5ee98788e38d1598bdb7f1903be6e4155e)

 

You fucking monkeys don't know shit. You're all too scared of your god damned shadows because this world has eaten you up and spit you out. You got one fucking win on Shitadel two years ago and you've been mowed down trying to relive that glory. You all remind me of those fucking apes in 2001 too afraid to step forward and transcend by touching the monolith  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHWs3c3YNs4 . But this ape, /u/ShittyStockPicker ain't afraid to take a fucking risk. 

I’ve been hearing about the impending recession since covid started, I’ve been hearing about the collapse of the dollar since 1990. The internet is full of bears who want to see America punished for its imagined sins: greed, debt, laziness. Why, if you listened to those fucking bears who hate this country and want to see it fail you'd think America was two Oompa Loompas away from being sung a demeaning song about why it fucked up and dragged off the world stage.   
But I'm not one of those America haters. I'm like Warren Buffet, I never fucking bet against America. Ever. 

The hard pill for America haters to swallow is that we are the best god damned system on the planet bar none. The culture we have built worships talent and those stupid enough to risk everything for a dream.  And we don't give a flying fuck if you're a queer dragon-kintyped non-binary star planet. If you're stupid enough to try the impossible, we're going to fucking cheer you on. And when you achieve the impossible, we're going to fucking reward you with it by both worshiping you as a fucking god and more wealth than you know what to do with.   


It's not that way in any other system. You won't find that in Europe, you're not going to find it in India. Don't even think about trying to find that in China.   
If you have a fucking crazy, insane longshot idea that just might fucking work the only people stupid enough to try live here. And its because if you're not descended from people who were told by their countrymen, ""Hey, Gus, just shut the fuck up about going to the moon already and eat your fucking gruel."" You said, ""fuck it, I'm going to America and studying engineering until I can build the biggest ass ladder I can possibly build!""   
And that's still the America I believe in. And I believe that's the America /r/WallStreetBets believes in.   
So is it any fucking surprise then, that once again the United States is at the forefront of yet another technological revolution that is going to profoundly transform global society, rearrange international power structures, and change everything? 

I've been struggling to explain what AI means to people. But here's my best shot, dumb fucks probably want to skip to the end for the TLDR: ***The Information Technology boom introduced sharing of information at 0 marginal cost. The AI boom is different from the Information Technology boom because it is the beginning of the generation of new information at 0 marginal cost.***   
***Information Age: Sharing information at 0 marginal cost***  

***AI Age: Generation of new information at 0 marginal cost***  

Let that fucking sink in. *Generation of information at 0 marginal cost from newspapers to rocket designs.*  

I don't know if you had the chance to listen to the $NVDA conference call, but holy shit I fucking creamed myself rubbing my dick to it. There's nothing that gets me off harder than Capitalism Erotica. 

What the $NVDA call revealed is that corporate America is scrambling to build systems that utilize AI to keep their businesses competitive. There is no reluctance to adopt AI the same way there was reluctance to adopt IT technology 20 years ago. That's going to make adoption of AI happen fucking fast!

Many current CEO's remember companies going bust, or losing market share to a rival who was faster to adopt groundbreaking technology. *The lesson they learned was that it is deadly to shrug off changes in technology.*

The first wave of the AI boom is in stocks like $NVDA. Demand for their chips is going to be insane. The next wave, we'll see this show up in six to twelve months or so, is going to be the companies who adopted AI early and found obvious and unexpected ways to take advantage of 0 marginal cost information generation. ***The moment a company who adopted AI reports that an AI technology led to a blowout quarter we're going to see an explosion in stock prices and unimaginable GDP growth.*** 

We’re not going into recession, we’re on the brink of pushing the world into an unprecedented era of GDP growth and exponential growth in the rate of improvement of living standards.

We’re months away from new all time highs on the Nasdaq. The American economy is about to rip the world’s face off with a GDP rally the likes of which the world had never seen. 

TLDR: HAHAHAHAHA BERSSSSS R FUKKKKKKKK

Made 200k but was so greedy even after Reddit told him to sell that he kept it (keep in mind he’s using Robinhood, the last broker I would want to deal with during bankruptcy)

"**I still believe in the long term $NVDA story.**

NVDA's 2nd quarter collapse in gaming has created an opportunity to buy a solid company on declines, ($120 to $150)

1)The collapse of GPU's used for mining is expected to lead to a drop of 38% in gaming sales for FY Jan 23.

2) Furthermore, used GPU mining cards which  were returned to the market, will also lead to further sinking ASP's. (Average Selling Prices)

3) Gaming inventory will take at least 2-3 quarters to clear. As a result, NVDA's FY Jan 2023 EPS will be closer to $3.5, a huge drop over FY 2022.

Why am I buying on declines?

* The long-term growth story is still intact; owning this stock for the next 3-5 years will pay off very well.
* Data Center growth will remain strong - Data center overtook gaming for the 1st time in 2022 and should grow 53% YoY to $16.3Bn for FY Jan 2023, as Gaming drops 38% to $7.8Bn.
* As NVIDA clears out its bloated gaming inventory over the next 2 quarters, I except decent growth in gaming as well in FY 24 and FY 25, especially on what is now a lower base.
* NVIDIA's CUDA software is a big competitive advantage and allows it to price its hardware much higher than competitors.
* The introduction of Hopper, besides additional revenues from its Mellanox acquisition will also contribute to revenues •
* NVDA also has an 11Bn auto pipeline over the next 5 years.

I plan to start buying below $150, 20% at a time. Given the current market conditions after Powell's hawkish speech, this stock could tank to $120.

At an estimated average cost of $135, I hope to make 33 times Jan 2025 earnings of $6.5 or $215 - a return of 60% over two years.

My revenue estimates for the next 2 years are as under. All numbers are in $Bn.

"Tesla's objective is to be able to make cars that everybody (well not actually everybody but you get the idea) can afford to buy. They have noted their prices have long been too expensive. So continued price cuts as conditions warrant or demand it is to be expected.

The question is what impact do these have on margins.

This is difficult to guess at as it often starts with the assumption that the cost for Tesla to build a car has not declined by a corresponding amount. Also, we have little insight into whether Tesla is in the process of a change that will cut costs in the near future allowing them to cut prices now at a hit to margins only to see those margins go back up as upcoming cost savings are factored in.

Regarding comparing Tesla to others here... Tesla is very profitable and can afford to move these numbers as they determine necessary. The others are losing money on EV's and any cut to prices will mean their losses increase and risk their efforts.",2023-04-19,"['Tesla', 'objective', 'able', 'car', 'everybody', 'actually', 'everybody', 'idea', 'afford', 'buy', 'note', 'price', 'long', 'expensive', 'continue', 'price', 'cut', 'condition', 'warrant', 'demand', 'expect', 'question', 'impact', 'margin', 'difficult', 'guess', 'start', 'assumption', 'cost', 'Tesla', 'build', 'car', 'decline', 'corresponding', 'little', 'insight', 'Tesla', 'process', 'change', 'cut', 'cost', 'near', 'future', 'allow', 'cut', 'price', 'hit', 'margin', 'margin', 'upcoming', 'cost', 'saving', 'factor', 'compare', 'Tesla', 'Tesla', 'profitable', 'afford', 'number', 'determine', 'necessary', 'lose', 'money', 'EV', 'cut', 'price', 'mean', 'loss', 'increase', 'risk', 'effort']",-0.08636363636363636
"It would be faster to buy a new Tesla.  Than wait for an appointment to actually get a service appointment to fix your current Tesla.  

That is the main flaw of Tesla’s zero dealership model.  Tesla has too many things going on the same time.  You’ll have to suck it up as customer since you don’t have no other recourse.  Since Tesla controls everything.

The traditional dealership model isn’t perfect.  But this allows carmakers to focus on designing and building better cars.  Without getting burdened by customer service support.  Since you have dealerships outsourced to handle consumer sales and maintenance service.  

If you are unhappy with how your dealership treats you as a customer.  You can go to another dealership.  Or get you car serviced by an independent garage.  With Tesla you can’t even do that.

It is 35.8 cm (14.1 inches) long and 16.2 cm (6.4 inches) wide, meaning we could literally stack several smaller RTX cards inside of it and still have some room to spare.

" I haven't posted here in awhile mostly because I havent had much to say. But I think the next couple of weeks will be interesting. I hate people who waffle so here's what I am saying in case you don't want to read the long post: the VIX is going higher and the market is going lower and there is already evidence the house of cards is teetering.

I am not going to discuss the terrible breadth in the market, or what the VIX is actually signaling the market will do in the next couple of months (move in a 1% range), or the fact that we are being invaded at our southern border, or that the market returns are largely due to five stocks, or that CMG has a PE of 55, Salesforce 961 PE, Zoom 187, NVDA 162, or that earnings were terrible if you remove cost cutting measures etc. None of that matters either apparently.

# When will this tight range end?

Way back in February, I posted somewhat jokingly that what would drive everyone nuts is if the SP500 pinned itself to the 4000 level. Here we are in June and thats effectively what its done. I've posted about my frustration, my bewilderment and then my conviction that when it does break, it will be to the downside.

Whats important is not to take one or two data points and then deduct a result that is full of confirmation bias. However, I believe we are close - like next two weeks close - to this market being able to break out of this range.

A couple of points (thanks again to my expat genius on Twitter @/frankoz95967943 who learned me the very complex details of this) - all of these I have discussed at length in posts on my sub):

1. VIX is being suppressed artificially. I have covered how in previous posts. Simplest way to know is to look at HYG. It normally correlates. Not anymore.
2. Oil is also being suppressed. Again, if oil rises, everything else rises in price. The Fed does not want inflation. Best way to fight inflation is to keep oil down. I've shared how they are doing this in previous posts. (links at the end)
3. The Japanese are the major fbuddy helping the Fed do all of this.

I have to tell you that in +30 years in the market managing assets, I have not seen a market like this before. It is unnatural and controlled. That's why the VIX keeps dropping when risk keeps rising. I have posted at great length about the outlier risks that currently exist (Ukraine, banks, etc.) so no need to get into that again.

# WHY IS IT DIFFERENT NOW?

So a couple of things have happened and a couple are scheduled to happen that have caused me to go out on a limb and say this: what the Fed can control is limited and the end is near. Yes, the Fed can print money ad infinitum, like they have been doing, and the Japanese can play their role, but at some point, outside events will occur that they cannot control. Even with the help of the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon and JPM.

Here is what has happened recently:

# TRIGGER #1: OIL being manipulated is close to being out of US hands:

1. As I postulated earlier, because the US keeps hammering down the price of oil, eventually those countries whose GDP is based on oil might decide they've had enough. Well, OPEC+ is communicating they've had enough.
   1. [Saudi Minister Says OPEC+ Could Cut Production At Any Time | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Saudi-Minister-Says-OPEC-Could-Cut-Production-At-Any-Time.html)
2. Then there is this: [Iraq And Iran Ignore U.S. Sanctions In Talks To Expand Energy Ties | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Middle-East/Iraq-And-Iran-Ignore-US-Sanctions-In-Talks-To-Expand-Energy-Ties.html)
3. There this: [Syria’s normalization signals a new Middle Eastern order (brookings.edu)](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2023/05/10/syrias-normalization-signals-a-new-middle-eastern-order/) <----- Let's not forget that Assad is a war criminal. So bad that the Arab league suspended Syria's membership in 2011.
   1. Of course, the NeoCons in the US govt respond by doing this: [US lawmakers introduce bill to combat normalization with Syria's Assad (yahoo.com)](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-combat-135934548.html)

The Middle East seems to be getting MORE peaceful, not less, Israel excluded of course. Why? I think its because they see that they have a shot at gaining more control over their regional politics AND perhaps a chance to wean themselves off of the US dollar dependance.

If the price of oil is allowed to trade freely, its going up. Period. If the price of oil goes up, inflation goes up.

# RESULT: If oil goes up, inflation goes up, and then the Fed will truly lose control.

# TRIGGER #2: DEBT CEILING TALKS

Lots of news lately about the debt ceiling. Of course the debt ceiling would not be a problem if the US just spent LESS but thats a moot point since thats not going to happen. I don't know if the US will default, probably not a full default anyway. BUT, the mere appearance of the possibility of the US defaulting will cause risk assets to plummet.

1. [Biden and Hill leaders postpone debt meeting as deal talks continue - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/11/debt-limit-meeting-between-biden-and-hill-leaders-postponed-00096548)
2. [McCarthy was 'disrespectful' in Biden meeting on debt limit, sources say (nbcnews.com)](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/mccarthy-was-disrespectful-in-biden-meeting-on-debt-limit-sources-say-173870149509) \- what a bunch of children.
3. [McCarthy blasts Biden after White House debt ceiling meeting (axios.com)](https://www.axios.com/2023/05/09/mccarthy-biden-white-house-debt-ceiling-meeting)

Look, they will raise the debt ceiling at some point. The question is how long it will take and who will blink first. However, the longer it takes, the more nervous the markets become.

Don't forget this too: ***The Treasury General Account fell to $154 billion, down from $184 billion on May 9th. In fact, at this rate, the account will be EMPTY on May 19th. OPEX.***

Don't be fooled by the chatter of deals and more deals. Yes, a deal will get done but the point is the SP500 is not trading like there is any concern.

# RESULT: The empty TGA will force the US government to RAISE rates it offers to investors to fund operations. Raising rates is bad for the market.

# TRIGGER #3: SHORT SELLING BAN on bank stocks.

Beyond the hypocrisy of this, compounded by the fact that other than Yellen, the main spokesperson trumpeting this idea is the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon, is the fact that the last time they did this in 2008 after Lehman, 3 months later the XLF was down 51%.

1. [JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wants US regulators to consider a ban on the short selling of bank stocks | Business Insider India](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-wants-us-regulators-to-consider-a-ban-on-the-short-selling-of-bank-stocks/articleshow/100169845.cms)
2. [Calls to Investigate Short Sellers Intensify as Bank Crisis Deepens - The New York Times (nytimes.com)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/12/business/dealbook/jamie-dimon-short-sellers-banks.html) <---short sellers as being blamed for bank failures - thats rich.
3. Oddly the SEC says nope.
4. TREASURY SECRETARY YELLEN TO MEET TOP BANK CEOS NEXT WEEK IN WASHINGTON: POLITICO <---- prob to discuss the $18b they are going to force on the banks to recapitalize the bank insurance fund.
5. Discussions of raising the FDIC limit to infinity <--- this is bank nationalization or rather, JPM et al.

# RESULT: A BAN WILL ONLY OCCUR IF ANOTHER BANK IS ABOUT TO FAIL - this is the only reason. IF IT OCCURS, BYE BYE MARKET.

# TRIGGER #4: MONEY IS LEAVING AAPL.

AAPL is close to an all time high. As AAPL goes so goes the market. AAPL's earnings S U C K E D unless you are a fan of gains due to outsourcing of labor overseas. Also, Foxconn, AAPL's largest supplier, reported a 56% drop in net income ( [Apple supplier Foxconn's Q1 profit plunges, outlook ""conservative"" | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-supplier-foxconns-q1-profit-falls-56-yy-worse-than-forecasts-2023-05-11/) ). Oh and Samsung Electronics profit fell 95% in first quarter. But yeah, AAPL is fine.

But while the stock is going up, money is leaving:

1. 2 billion left the stock May 5
   1. Money flowed in May 10th
2. Then this past Friday, 7 billion - and no its not repositioning or some other reason.

https://preview.redd.it/v1pmmktrypza1.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=19948a3be1f8e22977f858715ba1b1481db94995

***Since Jan 1, AAPL has added $760,000,000,000 in market cap. Sure, that makes sense.***

# RESULT: AAPL rolling over will pull the techs and the rest of the market down.

# All it will take is FOR ONE OF THE ABOVE THINGS TO HAPPEN and the market goes down.

# But wait, thats not all. Here are some possible ""canaries in the coal mine"":

# The VVIX, which is the volatility of the VIX, is going UP when the VIX is being manipulated going down. HUH?

1. The UAE announced a $10 billion short position on US stocks last week. What's odd is how public this announcement was.
   1. I believe this was another warning to Washington to knock off their manipulation of the oil markets.
   2. Our government responded 2 days later that they would start buying to refill the markets in June. What?? Why would you communicate when you will buy in the open markets? The US has publicly stated they will only buy when oil is $67-$72 per barrel. Either the US thinks thats where oil will be or they are communicating to OPEC+ (the + is for Russia) that they will be done screwing around in June.

# OTHER RISK BEING IGNORED:

1. US Banks - not any better regardless of what Yellen and JP and the devil say. There is a structural problem with regional banks: they cannot compete unless they take on more risk and that has led to them taking on more risk which is why the banking system is set to collapse - collapse into a national banking system, run by the devil of course. I am not a conspiracy theorist - if you understand how much money the TBTF banks are getting for less than 1% from the Fed, you understand that regionals dont have a chance.
2. Ukraine - there is still a war going on. People are dying. The US public is done caring about Ukraine having moved on to better things.
3. China / Taiwan - probably not this summer since Taiwan is going to be having an election in 2024 and if the KMT party wins, unification, i mean war is called off: China wins, without a single shot being fired. By the way, this is the great idea our leaders Washington have if China invades: [US Threatens To 'Blow Up' Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Firm If China Invades The Island; Taipei Unhappy (eurasiantimes.com)](https://eurasiantimes.com/us-threatens-to-blow-up-taiwans-semiconductor-manufacturing/) WHEN YOU HAVE FRIENDS LIKE US...
4. Commercial real estate market is already crashing but of course, nothing to be concerned about
   1. Here's a jewel in San Fran that was valued at $300m two years ago, now on sale for the low price of $60m ( [Commercial real estate in SF grapples with 350 California's expected (hoodline.com)](https://hoodline.com/2023/05/smaller-commericial-real-estate-san-francisco-versus-350-california-expected-to-drop-over-80/)
   2. And this in NYC that was valued at $125 m two years ago just sold for $13 million ( [Turtle Bay Residential Building Sells at 90% Discount (therealdeal.com)](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2023/05/04/failed-startups-turtle-bay-building-sells-at-90-discount/)
   3. CRE debt is a mess. I've already discussed it at length in previous posts. [Defaults on Commercial Real Estate Loans Surge to 14-Year High (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/distressed-cre-loans-rose-to-5-2-in-february-7373644) <--- this was a January article.
   4. Trucking rates are WORSE than the 2019 ""Trucking Bloodbath"" when 10 large trucking companies went bk. Truck rates are down to $1.19/mile with operating costs up $.30 mile since then. This doesnt even include rising finance costs. (thanks to Craig Fuller@freightalley on Twitter).
5. Other items of interest are credit card chargeoffs higher than 2008 levels, rising auto loan delinquencies, poor tax collections, layoffs, BBBY bankruptcy (this would've normally crashed the market for a day or so due to their large real estate holdings). But yeah, there's no inflation.

# And really, the big data point to me that proves without a doubt the VIX is being manipulated is the following chart which shows that normally, like the last 15 years, when yields move higher, the VIX moves higher (historical R [correlation] of 71.21%). But not this time I guess. VIX is purple, Yields are green.

https://preview.redd.it/tipkjui2zpza1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=127eacdf3d0ec7b58beb36f345b85022d3a184b0

# CONCLUSION:All it will take is for one card to fall in this humongous house of cards. And I only listed a couple of them.

The US stock market is apparently not concerned. Since the VIX is sub 17 and headed to 0.

The FED is controlling what it can. They are running out of time and money.

The next two weeks are crucial and I have little confidence in Washington <--- they will screw up enough where they can't hide it.

# KEY EVENTS:

* OPEX this Friday
* TGA runs out of money - probably this Friday
* Debt ceiling talks get ulgier - already happening.

***Watch for these for a blow off top:***

1. ***Celebration over universal*** *~~healthcare~~* ***FDIC insurance.***
2. ***AAPL sets a new ATH***
3. ***VIX collapses below 14***

**Disclosure**: I am LONG VIX calls from June to October. Heavy. Like 50%. In my 30 years, buying low VIX was a trade I NEVER lost money on. I trade options, daytrade ES and teach FOR FREE others how to trade (live trading on Friday). I am paying it forward.

I don't care if you agree, because I am right. Read my name - this isnt advice.

How do you think the US is able to manipulate the oil market other than Biden dumping shit loads of barrels on the market via the SPR (which is about to end). I’ve been wondering how the oil market has had so much weakness when in reality Biden and co. Is about to run out of oil to dump on the market while at the same time OPEC might cut more and we are in summer season which results in massive draws which were only being offset last year by his SPR draws. It’s been upsetting as on oil and gas investor to watch this fucking absolute ass clown in office fuck this up so bad. The rubber band affect is going to play out soon. Rig count is already dropping substantially again like in 2020. This will further decrease supply. The oil companies and investors like me are relatively pissed about how they haven’t let the natural functions of the market play out how they should have all for an election coming up. I think the end result will be an oil shock worse than 2022.

They have couple of new projects coming in this winter and the way this world move i don’t doubt they will be back at least at $200 zone until 2023 . I have and will keep buying shares as i am bullish long term (I have about 70 shares becouse as i mentioned i am broke .. But lately i thinking about options/ calls more precisely. Thinking about smaller strike price maybe $150 or so for later in the year. Am i dumb or really dumb? Help me make this stupid decision in beeing even more broke or very rich.

Today at market close the portfolio value is back up to $503k.

I sold the BABA and most of the MPW and BILI calls from last post. About 100% profit total.

I kept $44k of MPW calls, and Today i opened a bunch of puts on QQQ, NVDA, AMD, and SPY ($425k) expiring next week. 

For earnings tomorrow i bought 25k of BABA $90 calls, and $7k in Walmart puts expiring friday..
