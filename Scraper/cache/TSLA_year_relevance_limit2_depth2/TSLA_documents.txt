Nice retirement you've got there.

User is regarded
Lmao you bought calls after it alrdy ran up 100% from its Jan lows? Damn you‚Äôre regarded af
If only you bought puts ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630)
LoL...fucking all of us won't save you

Get ready to be penetrated day by day, inch by inch until expiry
This was highly regarded back in February when Tesla was still doing well...what the fuck were you thinking?...
Haven‚Äôt heard of stop loss before?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Look at this rich asshole with $12k.
Love this guys reply to everything as ‚Äúyep and fuck u too‚Äù truly my hero man
Long story short
Absolute WSB mentality.

Buy calls after a stock does a 100% gain. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Why the fuck did you even think this was a good investment? You could have just given me the money. I would have put it in a blender and lit it on fire. That would have at least been entertaining.

Did you not see the latest chart obviously the red is going down. That = lose money(red). You‚Äôre supposed to make money(green)
No Elon fucked YOU!!!!!!!
You obviously should have a legal guardian handle your every step.
Anyone who held calls a minute after 3:59 on Monday hates money
This is dead
You‚Äôre welcome to come speak at my daughters 12th birthday party üëë
Lmao lower your voice, you are the one taking in the ass üòÇ
Average down. Next month Tsla earnings. Obviously you have to average down heavier.
Tomorrow
Its okay bro im 26 ive never had or seen that much money
This is a tough spot because the expiration date seems reasonable but you likely have further downside. A true diamond hand test is in your future
The four biggest lies ever told:

1. I love you. 
2. The check is in the mail. 
3. I won‚Äôt come in your mouth. 
4. You should buy calls in TSLA.
Great work Daniel!
Puts on rocket man only until $98
Try this from now on: learn about the RSI on a stock chart. If it goes above 70 buy puts, goes below 30 buy calls. Early to mid February it was around 70.
I sold all my shares in my portfolio. You will be okay. It will skyrocket tomorrow
I clicked Exercise for you but it‚Äôs not work.
Don't worry man still 20% to lose
Not a recommendation, but TSLA chart looks totally awful.

I'll go all-in when it hit $90.
Still robinhood?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
Well done!
The dude is a right wing nutter butter who sits on Twitter all day retweeting other nuts‚Ä¶ you invested in that?
Elon fucked you and your wife..
Earnings on 4/17 there is still hope brother
You zigged, but you shoulda zagged
Should‚Äôve sold on Feb 17. Here‚Äôs your lesson on time decay
Oh yeah, you can say whatever you want alright. We're having a nice day out of your loss porn. Good luck bro. Don't rope.

I do not consent to this
Holy shit you bought them at 13$
Lemme know when you plan on buying puts
Dude get out save yourself. Mark this if you want but it will never break even by April.
Thank you for funding my put
The real question... How many hours of your life wasted does that loss represent?
Still has time to be right
For my next trick, buying puts at the bottom
I feel absolutely no sympathy for you whatsoever. This is what you get  for worshipping a giant pseudo intellectual douchebag who is poisonous to everything he touches.
U really bought at the tippy top ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Break even if $235.  
Lol
How do you maintain this terrible strategy

Your expiration date is better than the guy who bought Netflix puts for like, 3 days later
This gets me rock hard God damn ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
yk should‚Äôve taken that $60k or whatever you used and bought spy puts like everyone else. If i had 60k lying around i would be rolling in money by now
You're too busy fucking yourself at the moment.
Takes that 12k and yolo on 4 cent spy call options before CPI.  Maybe you get lucky
Run forest RUN yes I am in!
Take your loss and come back lol
![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
You‚Äôre an idiot
Stupidest MF of all time
like what goes through someones mind when you make this play
Hey at least you didn‚Äôt buy weeklies
I wish I could lose 40k man I miss the rush. It happens man bless you.
Don't worry, my 4/21 puts are IV crushed to shit
Honestly, sit.
Ouch?
OP really name is Dyson because he love to suck
He‚Äôs gonna YOLO and then cry about it!? ü§§ delicious
You have the right idea, just the wrong direction. Almost got it tho üòâ
This is the buy signal
what tiny dick would go long on Tesla after a huge brain dead bull run???? Lmao
LOL hey so next time you think you wanna do options cashapp your money to me instead
Let‚Äôs buy it after stock gone up 100 in few weeks ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
My guy my guy my guy my guy, Can I borrow 49k?
Oooff
My man!
delete the app and move to Mexico. That spanish class in high school is gonna come in handy here pal
Can somebody explain to me who dont understand what is going on - is OP losing 49k?
Over hyped and over valued, what could go wrong?
Let it ride. Til the wheels fall off
You‚Äôre a fucking moron for this position. What fucking actually were you thinking Lmao.
Jesus OP thought it was going to 234+ after the run it already had in this market! ü§£ addiction hotline is open 24 hrs
Don't blame others for your own regardation OP.
Hasn‚Äôt Tesla been bleeding like 3-5 bucks a day for the last week? üíÄ
Guh
Have a co worker who recently told me about his tsla calls and I was really feeling for him today ü•∫
12K more to lose!
All of who? We‚Äôve been calling for $TSLA puts for weeks. You‚Äôre so regarded that you inversed WSB bears.
You sir fuck off
My $100 puts did well today...
Sell before it‚Äôs too late. You can still turn that 12k back into the 50k lost
If it makes you feel any better my TSLA puts are printing.
No, it is you who are fucked.
Loss porn üß±‚¨ÜÔ∏è
It‚Äôs crazy how nobody thought of buying Tesla calls when it was $100 lol
haha! Loud and proud I see.
Wait what you bought calls??
What app or site is this (I'm new in this stuff)?
You bought calls after tsla ran up 100% from its low.
That's what happens when one rich dumb asshat sells his good shit for a meme coin and Twitter.
The stock has dropped for 6 straight months and people are still buying calls?
You should‚Äôve done the exact opposite. Duh.
You have until April, it'll be fine
My man thought TSLA was gonna repeat 2021
Go full regard, OP.
Fuck you back dick!ü§¨
Yeah that's what you get when you trade money you can't afford to lose with options lol And in one position nontheless.
The only calls people should be buying are inverse market tickers.
Loser
I'm down a higher percentage on my stuff
I hope it runs into ER for you

233 is huge in this macro though
At least he‚Äôs only down 40k now
Got over a month for stock to recover.
80% loss in just two months? Man, that's rough.
Didn't there used to be a rule on wsb, that you could only buy puts?
Chillax bro u got a whole month to lose that money
Hey Juju, fuck you too!
Lmao
In a matter of days, I‚Äôll be next shouting to all fk you ‚Ä¶.
Exercise it! so you can hold until TSLA bounce . that's the only way to win it back
I feel you bro, even thought I bought 1 contract
Learn about butterflies. . That way big swings either way make you a happy camper
169 is a good level to double down.  Always bounces off of meme levels
You still have time
Fuck you too, see you on Monday!
Naked calls... Oh no no no.
So you lost everything basically? Nothing wrong with that per se but fuck us? Nah, you got fucked. Most smart investors won't even tough Tesla right now, you put thousands into a call order. Oops ü´Ç
you are quite welcome my good fellow. no need to thank me.
Banks going bankrupt and this guy going for calls lmao
I always love people that see the classic pump and dump bells for the past 18 months and still think they're not at the top of yet another dump. If it's going up, you soon wont be. Puts print every time
One of us
Lol I'm glad I'm not you
Hope you‚Äôre right bro
If you regards will keep sending woods your money I might be able to climb my way back up to even money!
TSLA will come back strong. Look at the resistance today.
They never stop with the options do they
You have more than a month left, what are you complaining about?
Yeah my Strip did nicely that day.. Sold it out, and bought another today.. let's see how the weekend goes.
jesus crist
Good. Now we are even in a way my entire loss is in your one trade
What an absolute degen ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29093)
Well at least you had 60,000$ to gamble like a moron. You can tell your kids! If you just bought 60,000$ worth of the stock you would only be down about 5,000$. There‚Äôs always next time! Hope you‚Äôre wife‚Äôs bf gives it to her extra good!
421 lol you‚Äôve got time to make the ultimate comeback
Why would you put $60k in one stock???
Me too üò∂
This week -9500k Tsla
Looks like you got FUCKED good

But what did we do??
Now that‚Äôs the Wall Street bets spirit!! Sounds like üíµ!!!
Might be able to get SOME money back. Since bank failed fed might slightly reverse course on monday temporarily. tesla might make a run next week towards 200, just sell if it even gets near that. that's what I would do
That‚Äôs what happens when you don‚Äôt think from what‚Äôs between your two ears
Do we have a winner here ?

I‚Äôm bagholding 300 contracts.  We ride or die.
Wow this must hurt
Congratulations dipshit! Apparently you belong here. Most people look at Tesla like it was a fad ran by a compulsive liar, I mean confidence man, or  businessman that has consistently spewed pipe dreams to get his fanboy‚Äôs hard and dump their loads , I mean money into him. I mean his companies. Tesla missed out on the Electric Truck market and is probably dead in the water. All these gimmicks mixed in with the growth picture and the fact that Tesla was the only EV company over the last decade are going bye bye. Congrats regard.
Buy actual stock you f‚Äôin regard.
The next bank to collapse is a 100% confirmation of a Global Contagion / Financial Crisis. Which one do you guys think is next? Some highly speculative crypto bank / silicon valley?
Wow can‚Äôt believe some people never saw this rug pull coming!!!

Hahahaha you still believe in Elon lolololololol

The simp army is dwindling
Don‚Äôt worry bro it‚Äôs gonna hit 220.67
May God have mercy on your wallet
tsla has been on a downtrend past couple weeks. why would u buy these?
I am currently long TSLA contracts with an average cost of $2.79 per share. The current market value of my position is $12,276.00 and the breakeven price for my position is $233.80 per share. Today's return on my investment is -$6,644.00 (-35.12%) and my total return since I purchased the contracts is -$48,434
I saw the price of the stock went down today, have you tried averaging down?
Damn, 420 is on a Thursday.
And the GuY is officially an idiot. 
TSLA 2 points down markt open
Bro, you‚Äôve lost so much money, take a break
What was the share price when you purchased?
Nice n proper
Go go go shawty....it's your birfday.
Orgy!!!!!!

Oh dam
Those are so fucked
Thank you
Just do some dd on SIVB
I want VM take on this

Who's more regarded, the regard or the regard who follows the regard?
the problem is you shouldve bought 25 more calls than you did.  you fucked yourself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[removed]
Breakeven is so high, why?
Is this an offer to try and get your money back?
Good thing I shorted tsla
You going to wish you had that money by eoy trust me
Fuck you for choosing Wendy's what can I get started for you today?
Sell man, look at the fucking daily chart. This thing is back to $100 FAST
tsla takes another victim. valla con dios
This is just sad lol
Why didn‚Äôt you just buy puts?
Have you thought about doubling down???
Did you buy calls after a 90% run?
You should not have done that
Ouch‚Ä¶. And here I‚Äôve been betting TSLA hits 100 soon
Ur fucking awesome! Looks like my loss porn in weed stocks üòçüöÄ
[removed]
hehehe the Mexico Factor lol
Hahahahahha
Im convinced we are headed into the next Great Depression.  1929 now 2024 is my prediction.  Thanks all.

What in the actual fuck were you thinking?
What did WE do?
!remindme in 42 days
Bro learn to read candles
When you have that kind of money you sell options instead of buying
HFSP
How did you not put a stop loss when it hit the top? You purchased these in Feb!!! Bro send me a DM... I'll give you my cash APP and a dikc pick... and you can just donate it to me... lol
This is the kind of guy that fomos in or looks at 1day to 1 month chart. If you look at tsla one day chart it looks bearish as f
Same
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
buy the dip!
Regards, regard.
You got time bud! Month left to go
I made that much last year. I can't imagine working for an entire year just to see it all evaporate in less than a month
Dang, buddy saw Cramer say ‚Äúbull market‚Äù and went full regard ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Outch
Elon to the earth core
You probably could have gotten half a carton of eggs with that. Shame.
Who goes long when there are so many risks. could be war with China. Rising rates.
Anyone that can‚Äôt see that Elon is spiraling out of control deserves to lose money
Still have enough for pizza
Ya see, the stock is going the wrong way.
Bro could have bought a tesla, gave it to somebody that needed it a car, and still have more money ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Buddy you need to take this up with Elon, as long as Twitter has problems by extension anything else associated with Elon is gonna have problems
Better sell them before they‚Äôre worthless
So buy 100 of TSLA pre-market and write a covered $170 call?
Still have 12K left to gi

You are either a genius or a regard. Time will tell.
you got time.. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Holy shit. Thx god I bought that TSLA 180 put I sold.
Some of those contracts must have been purchased before 2/16 no? Imagine not selling when they were $20+
I hope it bounces back up. Sorry. I lost 180k 2 years ago i feel your pain.
Regard thought the dead cat was a comeback story ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
How dumb you gotta be to hold that much of a lost lmao
Tsla must be leap territory. This hurts to watch
Way to be down nearly 50K moron
Welcome home
You‚Äôd have been better off buying a Tesla and having it catch on fire and locking you inside.
You didn't buy after that Kathy woods crap where she said it was gonna sky rocket so she could dump her position did you ?????
This is almost as bad as when a homeless guy ignores you
Play stupid games, Win stupid prizes
You still got time bro. Tesla is regarded‚Äî it bounces up and down like a bunny.
Ouch
Blame SIVB we had nothing to do with this
F‚Äôd by the long dick of capitalism, classic lol
Lmao why dude just why üòÇ
![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637)
Bro now is the time for a heavy fucking dose of revenge trading
This is supposed to mean something?
you should‚Äôve bought more
Why those crazy calls? You got Elon‚Äôs meat down your throat or something?
Oh no , short Tesla it‚Äôs going down
‚ÄúHi I‚Äôm an idiot that bought Tesla at the top‚Äù
Why does no one use a SL or even aware of supply and demand? Like oh we gonna hit that supply. Better stop out
You still have a chance plus Wendy‚Äôs is hiring
You dumb shit.

Elon revealed how much of an idiot he is and the company is a laughing stock and you rolled 50k into options?

The money is in safer hands now.
Is this TESLA price before or after the steering wheels started falling off?
Who the fuck still buys Tesla calls. You!
Why did you hold so long with all the signs ? I mean wen it broke 190 exit. Ouch wish I had tbis much money to make billions.  (Kidding. Cheers üçª it‚Äôs a drinking kinda night).
What compelled you to invest in a company that has a CEO that lost 100 million from a tweet a few days ago
Yeah, I know the feeling
Keep in mind that, if the product a company makes is competitive, then a shitty CEO acting shitily is just a temporary damper on the stock and not reflective of the real performance of the company.

But I wouldn't bet on it myself.

People buying/selling stocks arent known for acting rationally and I will probably fall victim to apes together strong.
Dude it ain‚Äôt even 3/21. What‚Äôs your worry?
How did you not know Tesla was going down?
LOL bye bro
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
$233 breakeven lol
This was pushed to me by Reddit.

Not sure why, but it‚Äôs probably time to buy again. 

I‚Äôm thinking 300c end of April, then grab a Cybertruck for my troubles.
Dead Cat MeOwwSment
lmao
HAHAHAHAHAHA
At least there‚Äôs 20% left
Seems rough. Time to lay in the bed you made though
just buy the dip
And yet, most likely, all of us partaking in the sell, were F*-ing you. In the most regarded love kind of way. Xo üòò
Found the Elon simp
Chooot, wish i had play money to risk like that lol
Why did Tesla tank recently?
Wait for Tesla to go up 100% then buy calls. This is the way
Bruh 

FMV is $255!
Tesla options have cost this group billions
I‚Äôm just here for the ‚Äúfuck you.‚Äù
Go broke, bum
All of us?
Jeez 210 not even 200. Here‚Äôs a hint, big guys play at round numbers. The resistance at 200 would have kills these options regardless
the only thing dumber than betting against $TSLA is betting on $TSLA
That company makes no money. Why buy it at all?
"you only lose if you sell",  bro.. but hey fuck that theta decay .
This will go to the Moon. Patience young Jedi.
I thought of buying calls yesterday when it was at 185. I should of bought puts.
mamma mia!
Makes me feel better about my loss over the 2 years bc somehow you managed to lose more than I have over my entire trading career üò≠
Fuck you too!
Yea it‚Äôs hurting my shares too lol. What do you guys think about this in long term. Elon shouldn‚Äôt have taken twitter I really thought he was focused on technology.
the market just tucked you in
You‚Äôre dumb
Don't you look at trends??
Suck my brown hole
HAHAHA
Fuck it, I‚Äôll be one guy to hope it all turns around for you. You still fucked up. Bruh
Autosell reverse
It‚Äôs not too late to invest in twitter. Double down on the Musk train
/: sorry bro
I don‚Äôt imagine you‚Äôll answer, but I‚Äôm genuinely curious what your reasoning was for buying these at the time you opened the trade, and even more curious why you didn‚Äôt cut your losses yet. 

Have you considered selling shorter dated further OTM strikes as a poor man‚Äôs covered call while you‚Äôre still holding these?

üòòüñïüèª
I‚Äôm loading up on tsla puts in the AM, so I guess that means you will make it back plus some as it rockets back up to $220
Today was the first day I tried options trading. You seem like an expert OP. Any advice?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
That's a big Y I K E S my dude.
$TSLA is at its lowest point? Im illiterate
Thank you for your sacrifice my puts are actually about to break even.
You're fucked
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I think you might need a new Reddit account after this one
Fuck regular
Blame $SIVB for scaring tge banking sector which makes up a significant portion of our market.
Not getting any exercise...
Someone sounds angry, you should be mad at Musk he is the one that is sending his companies to hell, I did nothing.
Bruh don't blame us, blame Elon
Oooffff that‚Äôs hurts man
You still have time for it to turn it around, chill.....
Holy cow man‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Fuck you congrats
I heard Tesla is going to make a Train. The conductor is going to be OP.
Can I have your last 12k before theta takes it? Thanks
sex
If it makes you feel better, my Tesla Puts expired last Friday
Ooop, yo bad
See you Monday hahahahaha
DON'T YOU PUT THAT ON ME! YOU AINT NEVER GONNA PUT THAT ON ME!
J. Pow said fuck your calls! ü§£
Stoploss saves lives
Too be fair to OP, he bought 45 DTE with a solid target strike price. He just got fucked over royally today with a black swan event double penetration combo of Biden's tax hikes and bank risk announcements.
GOOD!
How big is your total portfolio
Tsla is a long term hold
Tesla I think should bottom around $60-65 in the next month
I recommended selling these calls immediately and just buy 0dte puts on SPY tomorrow. Maybe you can lose it all properly. These calls are worthless.
Time to sell while you still can.  Maybe learn a lesson along the way?  Eh, probably not.
It‚Äôs odd because I have seen non stop good news for Tesla. They literally have no international competition and in China no premium completion, sell every car they build, are building huge new factories and will dominate the spaces for at least the next 5-10 years. This stock feels like a slam dunk right now. GM, who ‚Äúled‚Äù the EV revolution are literally laying off anyone who will take a severance because they simply cannot do what needs to be done.
Wrong expiration day. Sound have gone with 4/20 bro
nice bro chase it after it ran up 100% nice play
Yeah think you're in for a world of pain my friend.
Is that good?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
So how are things?
One time, one walked across the street at me for ignoring him.
I mean, in due time, it will literally be that.
Except a homeless person has more money than the OP.
WSB is like asking that homeless person for investment advice.
Lmao you roasted the regard
You win the comment section
I'd almost rather lose 50k in one wack like this than lose the same amount over 6 monfhs at -1.5% a day.
Please stop yelling. Iam trying to sleep in the dumpster of Wendy's
This is like a crypto Karen
Good chance OP is homeless now
He‚Äôs talkin to himself tho

OP isnt homeless... *yet*
Spit out my CELH üòÇ
I mean he‚Äôs not technically homeless yet he could sell and keep his cardboard box.
>by a homeless person

give it time soon it will be OP
With this move, it will be OP yelling at you after he becomes homeless
Isn't it though?
This is like being yelled at by the homeless guys that just smeared poop all over the bathroom stall in Wendys and your shift just started.
Well if he wasn't homeless before he might be now.
It‚Äôs disturbing but you just grab your kids and tell them to ignore it.
I had a naked homeless addict swing a sword at me. He has just finished taking a shit in the middle of the intersection. Could the poster actually be him?‚Ä¶.
Had me rofl
Lmfao It‚Äôs like being told to take a shower and get a job by a homeless person
But thanks.
Fuc you

Thank you.
I bet OP picked 4/21 as an expiration date only because it was the closest to 4/20
Never go full regard.
You m-m-m-m-m-make me happy
Best regards

I remember one time this lady was yelling for a cop to "arrest that little boy" while I was sitting in a plaza having a smoke. Took me a second to realize that my 30 year old ass was the "little boy" she was screaming about, lol.
Same. And I have seen him just the night before and he totally forgot about me and railed at me for ignoring him the second time.
One yelled at me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre gonna die!‚Äù I was so freaked out for like a week. I mean he wasn‚Äôt wrong, but I thought maybe he meant like, soon. Anyway, I wished I‚Äôd yelled back ‚Äúwell so are you! And sooner than I am!‚Äù
I got flicked off by a homeless person at a stoplight just for looking at him. He was blind.
He was just stalking you because he knew you had gain porn for his addiction
I thought WSB was the homeless person giving advice.
WSB is like *letting* that homeless dude *give you* investment advice
He probably did lose 50k that way and wanted to win it all back in one whack
Elon fucced you
You just have to multiply it by -1 and it will be gains
You‚Äôre an idiot
You‚Äôre one in a WSB!
230c? I sold one of those for 17.20

Appreciate the donation
OP is now going to cash out what‚Äôs left and buy calls for June 9th.
You never go full regard.
The biggest of FOMOs
Sell now and use that 12k to buy puts and make it all back ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
You think people on this sub could afford that? You're dreaming.
Close this trade and sell in the money calls. üòâ
Arent u the same gal that dumped all your holding and went puts right at tht 99$ bottom?

It‚Äôs alright man we all lose in the end. If only I had half that money I‚Äôd be debt free. Good luck
My dude, I'm sorry for your loss, but take this moment to learn. You shouldn't be risking 44 call contracts worth of money on anything if you can't afford to lose all of it. I learned this the hard way with only 5 contracts, and LEAPS at that (generally the safest bet), when the market started to tumble last year. Lost a lot on that and I feel awful about it. It was all I had besides the long stocks I own. So now you know, don't ever bet the whole savings/paycheck/checking account on a risky thing like options. Bet maybe 15%, and even then only when you understand the math involved fully and are confident that the stock is at a fair price (or an unfair price if going short). Other strategies exist. You should watch InTheMoney on YouTube. Adam explains everything really well and strategies. People like to say YOLO. They're absolutely full of shit. You Only Live Every Day Of Your Life. There are a million chances to correct this. And a million chances for the YOLO attitude to fuck it up. Be meticulous.
Taking the loss is so hard but your account depends on it. This morning I was so frustrated because I entered spy puts yesterday and got wrecked in the morning bull breakout. Painfully accepted the loss and actually re-enter my position seeing weakness in the 1st hour and finally hit a winner! I like to remind myself it‚Äôs a game of probabilities and the one trade I wasn‚Äôt going to take would probably have worked.

Op about to get daddy's belt across their ass for this level of regardedness
Every time Elon tweets OP loses a grand.

I know, I know, fuck me. Love you, OP.
Ouch, truth
Fuck both of you!!!
Maybe you‚Äôll have his bay-bee
So use the non risk money...? It's risk-free, that literally means you have nothing to lose because it has no risk. I cannot possibly imagine how this can fail.
Well tsla is a weird animal. Don‚Äôt loose your hopes. At least they‚Äôre not FDs
We ride
You had 50bands
12-50k yeah never. I live paycheck to paycheck you are surprised?
Lol people said the same fucking shit back in Dec.
More like theta
Been there. I mean like one thousandth as bad, but it felt this bad
Jokes apart. I hope your account size is big and you are investing reasonably. If not stop gambling. In my case, I realized after losing 43k. Your tolerance level might be different. But any take too much time and money to realize. Cut losers soon
I am balls deep with my calls üòÖ it might turn, we still got time,

Really? Exp 21/4??
I guess often older people forgot about their age too.
Wait, you got railed by a homeless person?
I gave a homeless man the rest of my pack of cigs and a couple tacos and he's like " can I go home with you?" I said " sorry man but the wife wouldn't like that and I'd be out here with you" jokingly. Then he said something real fast I said I didn't quite understand  he says " can I suck your dick? " "Hahaha naw dawg!" Lmfao! "Im good I don't swing like that but take care and stay warm man" so he's sucking my dick and......
I can't stand it when you people ignore me .!
"..probably !

Watch it moon to $233 as soon as he does ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
$12k wont give him 100 shares of TSLA to sell a call, I would say Go all in on another trade and try you luck
This employee looks like they're doing the advert at gun point
Is this Hide the pain Harold's sister?
Holy shit the desperation in those eyes
Appreciate your words. 

Nicely fuck you.
Exact same thing happened to me.  Got super smacked in the bull ramp, had a feeling it was fake nonsense, bought some puts this morning, got crushed at work all day... FINALLY had a chance to look at them and they +250%'d on me.
Not too long, or your neck won't break.
Hahaha I know right ! That‚Äôs the only reason I had faith. Fuckin faith aye.
Risk money
I know.

At $90 the market cap would still be higher than any other auto maker which is absolutely insane, since it sells roughly 10% of the cars as Toyota, for example.

The only value in Tesla is hype. And that hype will completely disappear when the bigger automakers catch up in the EV market, which is already happening.

Thats very unlikely. The patterns pretty set in stone atm.
It‚Äôs Home Depot. Most likely a nail gun.
She bought 0dte spy calls that day. It was a bloodbath.

Not everyone wants to go into crippling debt for a degree in a field that they aren‚Äôt sure they have an interest in ü§î

Eg. my ex that got halfway through a marketing degree, dropped out, and still owes like $50k (8yrs later)

Or one of my brother‚Äôs exes that went to law school, became a lawyer, realized she hates her field but can‚Äôt quit because it‚Äôs the only field she can work in that pays enough for her to pay off her student loans, so she just drinks a lot and goes back to work‚Ä¶sounds lovely
Ohhh okay!! I see you!! LETS RIDE!!!

Careful with this one man, broken clock is still accurate twice a day, never forget!
I like people taking risk when nasdaq is about to finish its rising wedge
I actually agree with him on this one
Elon needs more liquidity to sell I guess
Elon also just got called to testify in the epstine case.   So yes puts.
Literally just bought a weekly call ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
TSLA has been a buy, don't care what Cramer says.
Until the self driving lawsuits for unintended deaths
My May 19th Puts needed this! Teala $166.60 tmrw then free fall Friday at 159.69üòé
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260) it was fun while it lasted...Puts it is
Most of the cramer memes I see seem to show declines in 2 to 3 weeks. 

Anyone with more cramer reversing experience know what duration to shoot for?
lmao i sold at $173 today too. thank god i got out lmaoo. might be my best play yet, ty cramer üòÖ
If Cramer says puts.... Buy calls..  Cramer's is always wrong
I would definitely agree with Cramer on this one. Tesla is a great company and their stock performance has been fantastic lately. I think they are a good buy at the moment.
Very glad you posted this op, this sub definitely needs another ‚ÄúCramer says this, (puts/calls) it is‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

So puts! Ok üëå
Cramer no! Bad Cramer!
Can't we find anything better than the beaten to death Cramer joke by now? 

Please why can't it just die.
Good sign that this forum is owned and paid for by CNBC. Nobody cares what Cramer is doing and he‚Äôs right half the time anyway.

Fuck Elon and his door stop truck.
Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.
