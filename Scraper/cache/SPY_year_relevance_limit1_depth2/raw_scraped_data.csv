Started with $12 last Monday. Bought 2 SPY 410p for Tuesday then started blowing up.,2023-05-10
Took the gains from SPY and shorted SBUX for earnings. Then took part of that and shorted IEP. From there shorted PYPL earnings. Then shorted ABNB. Now shorting CMG is currently my only open position.,2023-05-10

I turned 17k into 86k then cashed out.  That was 3 years ago.  I have lost every subsequent deposit since then.  More recently I turned 500 to 5k in 3 days then back to 200 in 2 days.  Take the money and run for your life.,2023-05-10
