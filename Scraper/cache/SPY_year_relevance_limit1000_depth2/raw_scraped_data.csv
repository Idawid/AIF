Started with $12 last Monday. Bought 2 SPY 410p for Tuesday then started blowing up.,2023-05-10
Took the gains from SPY and shorted SBUX for earnings. Then took part of that and shorted IEP. From there shorted PYPL earnings. Then shorted ABNB. Now shorting CMG is currently my only open position.,2023-05-10

"I opened some SPY puts yesterday and they expire today. Yesterday I was up nearly $5,000 and I know for sure they would be up $500,000 today. 

I contacted a RH special agent specialist to make sure I can sell my puts for $500,000 today. He said it was stupid and dumb but I’m pretty sure he confirmed it. Please check the attached screenshot for proof. 

Well turned out they actually expired yesterday. But my phone was dead during market close so I didn’t get to close them and they expired “worthless”.

This is unacceptable and I am suing Robinhood for $500,000 due to the negligence of their company and their inability to provide accurate value to my incredible investments!!",2023-05-02

"Even though I wouldn't recommend YOLO'ing your entire savings on short term options I think you will be good here. The US Treasury yields have been getting beaten down all week, along with the US Dollar Index. Yet SPY is down for the week. I think this market is just waiting for a Santa Claus Rally explosion. If the Wholsale inflation report is just 'better than expected' which has usually been the case with these inflation reports as of late I think the market can have a huge rally tomorrow. With that said inflation is still outta control and these markets in the long term will tank. But tomorrow I think you are mint. But at the same time what the F do i know 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️. I'll be looking to set up 0DTE put credit spreads tomorrow if that report is better than expected. But GL and Cheers and Salute young man!!  🍾🍾🥂🥂",2022-12-08

I turned 1.5k of fun money into 7k doing the same. SPY 375P expiring today. Cashed out 4k and pre-paid taxes on my capital gains which I’d highly suggest. I do this immediately after any time I pull out gains with my fun option money so if I am to lose in the future at least I’ll have a fun lil return check for overpaying taxes. Have only had that happen once (2019) but I’ve been a lot more conservative since then.,2022-09-23

"Americans, what is a pension? 

Instead of gambling on Nasdaq Call Options, the Japanese have a National Pension for retirement.

Even though the Nikkei has yet to reach a new high, it was better for the bubble to pop. Low inflation and Japanese people became more reluctant to spend money. Combine that with stable prices and a fixed income. Retirement seems pretty good in Japan.

https://hbr.org/1990/05/power-from-the-ground-up-japans-land-bubble

"900k+ gains today, $17,000,000 margin call guh, SPY Iron Condor - 9000 SPY contracts",2023-04-27
"&#x200B;

[Was trying to close my first +$1m day in trading bingo \(it hit $1.2m on amazon AH but a last min drop at 4:15 bumped it to $919k\).](https://preview.redd.it/52w0nafauhwa1.png?width=1712&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9f58fc24497ff3802897b707f663f70d5ee18937)

I have been on a bit of a downward spiral (was still playing with gains for past month) when I was sitting on a 4x-5x of 7800 SPY puts (changed too fast but gains were about 600k+ when I tried to close).  I had been burned on CPI before (see other posts about losing 210k in about 4 seconds last year) so bought some puts as a hedge on other positions and DCAd a bit too aggressively and ended up with 7800 contracts at a price of \~.17.  Lots were 10s of thousands on bid/ask but when I tried to close, it shrank to 1 to 50 and the candle would jump on each limit order (had to market sell) as this is approx $300,000,000 in notional value.  (Schwab also sucks balls on option order execution).  Instead of 600k+ in gains, I ended up closing for 15k in gains with a hurt mojo at the money I could have had and had fun losing later.

Last week I wanted to enter an iron condor but by the time my money swept from my futures account, it was too late.

On this Monday around open, I entered into a slightly bullish Iron Condor of 9000 contracts with expiry 5/1 and then jumped on a 4 hour plane trip which was delayed 2 hours without wifi, fingers crossed.

Strikes were:Long 2250 SPY 409pShort 2250 SPY 413pShort 2250 SPY -414cLong  2250 SPY 418c

Break even was 410.xx on low end and 416.xx on upper end.  Max gain was \~700k if spy closed between 413 and 414 on 5/1.  Max loss was \~300k.

[Iron Condor entry](https://preview.redd.it/eprp1x3qphwa1.png?width=2612&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f428a6ba618cdb770619002304817546d59116d6)

Monday went OK.  Tuesday and Wednesday killed me...  Max loss.  I decided to leg out of the calls leaving \~60k on the table on the gains side in case it bounced back.

Was now down over 300k yesterday and Schwab flashed a ""total lose of 750k"" on screen.  I assumed this is normal as their % stuff is shit and nearly always wrong, and I usually just watch account balance. In the middle of the night it showed account balance going from 1.1m to 400k.  I got a tad worried as no calls, no emails no notifications.  Found out at 5am EST that 884 of by 413p I shorted were assigned early, and I was now long 88,400 shares of SPY which I sold at 413 overnight as there was no time value left on the 413p.   The extra loss was due to a reporting error in their shit UI.

GUH

[What a dick](https://preview.redd.it/m9iu0g7oshwa1.png?width=1826&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f9f9ce9c535eb4926666340bee7f498d44f16409)

I proceed to call Schwab and was alerted that I was now holding \~$36,000,000 of SPY in an account with \~$1m and had a $17,000,000 margin call  


&#x200B;

[Edited to remove acct better](https://preview.redd.it/ybodvth6alwa1.png?width=1752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=40a272b460fe0bc48086dcfd7b0396bdd49e587a)

I was a bit worried they would sell the shares pre market or after open all at once on a market order, leaving me lopsided with my 409p in a rising market (this was worth \~$1.2m around close yesterday).  Schwab encouraged me to exercise the 409s but I said I would watch GDP first as there may be time value left with the market rising.  Market kept going up, sure enough there was.  Reminder, check time value when exercising.

At open I had to have a broker on the phone for 90min while I slow walked sell orders of shares/puts to not be lopsided in the trade and tried to get benefit of the rising market.  I obviously wanted to keep them as long as possible as my max downside was already hit and I could only go up (assuming they didn't market sell the shares and leave my long puts or exercise for me, killing about 250k in time value).  I hand typed sell orders in lots of 1000-4000 for shares/puts for 90 min with a broker on the phone who was also talking to risk management.  Dude was seriously the most helpful person ever.

The exercise cost me about 300k-600k (who knows exactly with their shitty UI) in additional gains today on top of the 900k since I could not hold them due to not having $17m under my mattress that I could send on a moment notice.

The remaining of gains today was some revenge trading of about 8000 SPY call options at couple strikes which I bought Wednesday night.

[Was trying to close my first +$1m day in trading bingo \(it hit $1.2m on amazon AH but a last min drop at 4:15 bumped it to $919k\).](https://preview.redd.it/52w0nafauhwa1.png?width=1712&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9f58fc24497ff3802897b707f663f70d5ee18937)

If the AMZN pop holds, I may have another 100k-400k in gains tmrw on other positions.

Good luck tomorrow, going hiking with the kids.",2023-04-27

"ahh the stupidity of WSB just shining through again

&#x200B;

if you used a chart other than fucking googling the stock ticker you might gain some more clarity 

\~4189 high over past month

\~4050 low over the past month

thats a 139 difference

lets even be nice and take the low 4050...so 139/4050 = .034

or 3.4%

Oh no look at this rollercoaster however will I deal with a \*checks notes\* 3% swing in the S&P over a month!

Total bond market ETF. For me this is a perfect set and forget method and all I have to do on a yearly basis is change the percentages of allocation.

Think there may still be some room to run up tomorrow morning which is where I would slowly scale in more (10-15 contracts per .~3%). Twitter heads turning bullish calling for 4300. 

Think we see a spike in vix and a solid 1.5-2% drop on spy within the week. Leaning towards it happening Thursday.

90% of the stock market is owned by the top 10%.",2023-04-12
"It's because the market is willfully ignoring what the Fed has repeatedly, and very plainly stated that they intend to do. The reckoning probably won't happen until sometime around the end of Q2 this year, when the impact of the rate hikes they've already implemented finally starts to really show up in corporate earnings. First, consider the problem they're facing:

Shortly after COVID hit in 2020, most of the world's economies shut down, reducing demand somewhat, but also reducing production (i.e. supply) to a far greater degree. We ""printed"" the money to find the stimulus packages, which increased the US money supply by about +30%. That was inflation from 2 directions at once, and the sanctions against Russia added a third by removing one of the world's largest suppliers of energy commodities. 

Despite all of that, if the shutdowns had been temporary and COVID had worked its way through the global population as quickly as everyone expected at the time, inflation might indeed have been transitory, as Powell said at first. We would've gotten a few quarters of sharp inflation, the economy would've digested it, and things would've normalized. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead, the largest consumer economies (US, Europe) reopened relatively quickly, but the largest producer countries (China, India) are also the most densely populated, so they've largely had to remain shut down.

Essentially, we've now had a couple of years in which consumption (demand) has been significantly higher than production (supply). We've burned through our reserves, so unless production ramps up significantly or demand drops significantly, inflation will persist. The Fed can't do anything to increase production, resolve COVID, or reintroduce Russian energy commodities (or even the domestic ones we lost when the current administration halted issuance of new drilling contracts on federal lands) to the global supply. What they CAN do however, is:

1. Make capital prohibitively expensive

2. Increase the ""risk free"" rate to make an investment in treasuries more attractive to corporations than investment in expansion projects

3. Destroy enough personal wealth and income to force a significant cut in discretionary spending

When ""peak oil"" fears started driving inflation in the early '70s, the Fed pussyfooted around interest rates for fear of creating a recession, which led to a nearly decade-long recession that was driven by a combination of persistent inflation and high unemployment. I'm 1980, then Fed president Paul Volcker declared his intent to ""break the back of inflation."" He jacked the Fed Funds rate up to 20%+ overnight. That drive demand down far enough for production to catch up, and then drilling tech advanced. 

Powell is trying to do the same today, but the market has gotten so used to perpetual cheap capital, that few investors today have ever even experienced a protracted economic/market downturn. They're all betting on the Fed pivoting as soon as they see any sign that inflation is starting to abate, working under the assumption that the Fed's greatest fear is causing a recession. 

Their ACTUAL greatest fear is repeating the mistakes of the '70s, so I think they'll keep the pressure on until inflation actually REACHES their target+2.2% rate and they're fully confident that it won't just spring back as soon as they back off. Once investors finally come to terms with that reality, we'll see the market bottom.

Of course, there's always the possibility of some kind of miracle between now and then, but I wouldn't bet on it. However, with that said, shorting is expensive no matter how you go about it, and the market can remain in denial for far longer than you can remain solvent. Without knowing someone's full individual financial picture, I wouldn't dare to offer specific advice on how to weather the storm, but there are a number of lower cost/lower risk strategies that I think would be much more attractive than trying to maintain a long put option strategy indefinitely.",2023-04-12

$30k->$515k in SPY puts,2022-06-10
"Today was my best day in the Market, account up $364k just in a day and $515k up in last 2 days.

Was holding $171k in 1DTE spy puts (405p, 06/10) overnight before CPI data which were 400% up already, could have easily lost all gains next day. Call it lucky or whatever, I did take a risk and it worked out, after failing over and over (especially with options).

More than 2 years ago just before covid I was introduced to FD's by this group and I was idiot buying puts when we witnessed greatest bull run in the history after covid crash.

However today, I made up for all losses and more than doubled my portfolio where I was before covid.

All I want to tell all the retards here that Its ok to risk some when you're young. America no longer rewards those who are financially responsible. Debt is a part of life. Having debt is the only way to get yourself into more debt like a better house or car everything needing an excellent credit score.

Oh, you paid off your student loans? Get a car. Oh you paid off your car? Buy a house. Oh you paid off your house? Save for your kid's six figure college fund. Oh all that's done? Hope you have enough left for retirement and enjoy your last 10 years of life, thanks for contributing to society with your 9-5 life.

We all need to hit it big. That's why we're here. Fuck those 1% saving accounts. Go for the millions. If you don't make it, it doesn't matter anyways because most of us will die working. But at least you would have tried, which is more than the most.

I Finally achieved goal of getting account to seven figures and now I decided not to buy any call/put options but might sell some occasionally.

Good luck to all you degenerates, keep fighting and one day you will win or get lucky just like I did!!

**CPI**

So everyone wants to know… CPI what will it be and where is it going next? And most importantly how will the market react… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qy8ssj6y8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=866aedc7efbc142cdf03e4db30c171dbaedf67ca

Based on my analysis here these are the probable numbers we shall see tomorrow… but of course here is my actual prediction… 

CPI YoY- 5.1%  
 CPI MoM- 0.5%  
 CORE YoY- 5.5%  
 CORE MoM- 0.4%

So now the biggest question would be… how is the market going to react? 

Well currently the market in my opinion expects CPI (inflation) to continue to unwind… they expect that inflation is under control and will continue to unwind straight to that magical 2% area… well in doing so they have put themselves in a TERRIBLE position… why? Well the markets have priced themselves into a corner where they see a pause in June… no hike/ cut in July… then 3 cuts at the meetings after to get to a 425-450 fed funds rate by end of year…

Whats the issue with this? Well its simple… IF CPI rebounds or shows any signs of plateauing… whats the reaction going to be? Well they are going to have to price in a 25bps rate HIKE at the June meeting… and that is going to mess up all of this markets plan for 75bps of cuts by EOY. 

If CPI comes in hot on YoY and Mom tomorrow in my opinion we are looking at a true 2-3% melt down and not only that but we are going to continue to sell off the rest of the week… the only thing that could stop that is a cool PPI print the next morning. 

If markets has to reprice their fed funds rate by EOY this could be the catalyst markets have truly been waiting for. 

Now if I am wrong and we get a CPI of 4.9% or lower… well lets just say we are probably going to see a rocket ship to 440 within a very short period of time… 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ld6nbr1z8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=da64bd7110a145c1bd9713894d8ce4c4fe852a4f

SPY daily did not establish a new supply at 412.99 as I was expecting it too… though tomorrow if it is red we should establish a new one there… 

I see that we closed directly in the middle of this range… that means our upside target is really 415.56 to 417.03 and our downside target is 404.3 to 405.06. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qi4xaggz8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f9fe75464829482cbf4c40084c584d435b5e7309

Absolutely BRUTAL price action today with no continuation and lots and lots of tight ranges… we spent an hour an 6 cent range at one point… 

We have a major downside support at 405.2 then 399 and we have a major upside resistance at 416.8 then 419.5. 

Possible CPI Targets

Bulls- 416.84 (1.45%+) -> 419.5 (2.08%+)

Bears- 405.2 (-1.4%) -> 401.4 (-2.33%) -> 399 (-2.93%)

For me I don’t think that the upside case is there for me as VIX is so low and really CPI is already EXPECTED to come in lower and lower… a surprise upside beat especially that 5.1% im looking for with MoM rising would absolutely start a huge leg down though… for me im bearish. 

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/baoys2wz8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e10d6ae8a9a1bc2c7bbe8c9ffe5c2ab95a47a52f

Now interestingly enough futures DID turn 4152 into a new supply (resistance) which means that our target should be 4073 minimum but I still am eyeing that 4040/4055 supplies that we have come ever so close to so many times… 

If we get an upside beat tomorrow then we would look for 4190-4198. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7htphta09vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e1303baf31017afdb3da0ccb2e519f6ff08ed332

Futures impressively only put in a 22 point range today… that’s a very small movement for nearly 24 hours of trading… 

CPI potential targets

Bulls- 4198 (1.51%+) -> 4237 (2.4%)  
 Bears- 4073 (-1.53%) -> 4055 (-2.01%) -> 4040 (-2.34%)

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jws3dca19vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dce6078b4bc6bdde11c8f175352e620419407da9

Started tracking the VIX on TOS and idk why just sometimes it just looks nicer then TV… maybe it’s the dark mode… jk light mode for life! 

Anyways the VIX continues to hold just under that daily 20ema. You can see we are really in a diamond pattern here which means if we can break through 20.42 (+15.4%) tomorrow then we might actually be looking at a bigger upside push to 22.6 to 24.18… if that happens then we are looking at a fairly big dump on SPY which would correlate with a CPI miss…

However, if we break support tomorrow of 17.32 then we are going to look to target 15.72 support once again.

Fun fact… this is the LOWEST the VIX has closed pre-CPI in over a year of CPI releases… 

Once again the risk is to the downside not the upside… actually something else that is incredibly impressive to me is the fact that the IV on 1dte contracts for tomorrow closed under 20%... that’s incredibly low… I remember a time when SPX ATM contracts were like $4000/ play… you had to go almost 20 strikes OTM just to get a lotto sized play… IV used to easily hit 80-100% on CPI days… IF we get a big miss and surprises tomorrow puts might see some fireworks. 

I did not open up longer term (60dte) puts today… I wanted to but with the cheap 1dte I decided to swing a 1dte put instead… my thoughts here is that if we miss I will win big… if we beat with IV this lower and only being a handful of strikes OTM with the probability of another flat open I should be able to get out relatively unscathed… I would then look for the 418-420 range to start a long term bearish play. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k5i6ilr19vya1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2873af10995aaac22159f94af4d94ae3570fe6a5

Today was another hard trading day with this tight ranges and lack of continuation… I made a few good trades and made some bad trades… the biggest issue was even with 1dte I found that when I was correct the underlying just didn’t move enough to pay us for our efforts. Ended up barely covering commissions today and still have a little red hole to recover from this week.

It has been setting itself up as a perfect storm and I'm crossing my fingers hard that you're right.

"Can’t help but be bearish. CPI coming in hot tomorrow and Aprils CPI might come in hot too. Since services inflation is what’s sticky, I see more people going out and spending money during the summer months. Summer is usually the time where people go out and enjoy the sun and spending money eating at restaurants, going on vacations, etc. All contributing to an increase in CPI for Aprils and maybe June. Of course, this is just my wild ass guess lol",2023-05-09
"Funny, how CNBC is making such a big deal on the debt ceiling. Since that was another in-pass tonight with hopeful future talk, and the CPI is hot...  Ouch. If the PCI is softer on Thu overall that is still bad for the economy, but after 24° time, that # could be considered great.",2023-05-09
"I am bearish and I want this market to crash really, really, really bad, but I’m starting to temper my expectations. The market is literally showing us that it’s not in panic mode right now, with price action and the VIX. And everyone has already seen the forecasts showing inflation will be flat to slightly up. 

If we see an initial dump on a 5.0-5.2% print, I plan on selling a put in nasdaq futures. (I’m already positioned bearish so it’s really just a hedge on myself. And I think tech will remain the safest sector. At least until we’re on our way out of the impending recession, which is taking a long ass time to show itself.) 

Honestly any signs of a hot economy, including hot inflation, are just going to give more motivation to the dip buyers. At this point I think a big downside surprise in inflation gives us the best chance for a sustained selloff. The real pain will be felt when there’s proof that things are cooling down.",2023-05-09

"There's been a lot of smoke around April 2023 CPI. It seems reasonable to expect a higher-than-expected CPI print. That said, keep in mind that April 2022 CPI print was 8.3%. One of the highest prints on record. So your baseline here is pretty high.

For context, Brent Oil was $105\~ in April 2022, the Fed had just started raising rates, and the housing market was still near its peak. CPI is a comparison versus last year. So it's hard to see a major upside surprise. Certainly could see a small miss here, but IMO it's not enough to warrant major price action.

Furthermore, the Fed Nowcasting system is showing some major improvements for May 2023 already. We're on pace for 4.41% CPI in May 2023. The market may already be looking forward and a small 10-20 basis point surprise could have limited impact on the market.

Sophisticated trading desks have also become much better at predicting CPI than they were one year ago. Today, these moves contain much less surprise for the overall market. In 2022, CPI quickly began to define market direction. The market was unprepared and was not tracking CPI closely enough based on its impact on price direction. The market has evolved by tracking CPI much more closely and positioning itself appropriately going into a print.

Also keep in mind that we saw some downward surprises in CPI earlier in the year which really didn't have much impact on the market. The initial move was there but didn't have much staying power, because the market quickly shifted to worrying about a recession.",2023-05-10

5 figure day with $SPY and $TSLA,2022-12-23
"The $378c was one I took at 2:40pm. I started out with a smaller position, and added more positions onto the continuous structure as long as we were above EMA every 5-10 min, and as soon as we broken above middle band of VWAP I added a lot more. I also waited for strong buying channels / volume. 

However, everytime I added my position I reset my SL to follow it. I had a 10% stop loss for half of the position if it hit, and if it hit 15% it would sell the rest of my position.

As we went higher, I just moved my SL right behind it. This way it let me take bigger risks, but I was still hedged

The others were plays I took as we rode the rollercoaster of hell downward in the first half of the day.",2022-12-23

"Well most of us who have been trading for a while know that yesterdays technical defying rally was and should be seen as the exception not the normal… However, back to back moves like this is exactly what this market does to try and convince people this is the new normal “just by calls and let it ride.”

However, I am the first one here to say that this is not the normal and thinking that you can just buy calls and let them ride all day to be immensely rewarded will leave you and your port burned out by the end of next week if you even make it that long. 

We got a lot to unpack here…

**Sell in may and go away**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d1cr88m02qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b4328183a3dc295733e098022e14230b17877641

If you have been around trading for any amount of time you know that historically speaking we end up with articles saying to sell in May and buy back in October. What I find hilarious if you type in “stocks sell in may” to google right now these are the first two article that pop up… The Media has a way of not only keeping us on our toes and they also have a way of shaping the narrative to fit their needs. 

**Bank Crisis** 

If this feels like déjà vu to you well it should… why? Because guess when the last bank collapse happened? It happened the week before FOMC (relatively speaking)… And now the quiet week right before FOMC what do we have? We have FRC officially going under… Officially as of EOD here we are with FRC being taken over by the government and going into receivership. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sb5r4k212qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bbbd85dc645eb5f7f4352acbdd49980cae0ba646

If you traded today then you saw the massive market drop we had from 1030 until 11am… At that point you would have thought it was over for the bulls and that market much like in March with the SVB issues would see a huge drop and that would be it for the bulls… 

However, we regained strength and some how managed to continue to push up EOD. This further fits not my theory I mentioned last night that I truly believe this is a run for the exit and retail is being left as the exit liquidity. 

I have two questions… whos next (bank wise)? And how does this effect FOMC next week? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjnvcxq12qwa1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=57eb264aa37d0e76df84491e278efac1a69b9215

So now JPOW is in a REALLY tough place here… why? Well he has to now answer for how SVB and FRC are both outliers and there contagion hasn’t truly set in now… The next question is that last FOMC jpow DID consider a pause but they still went ahead and got did a 25bps rate hike… 

JPOW also mentioned that rate hikes is still his base case… meaning he expects to continue to hike and definitely is not planning to pause…

FOMC Wednesday is likely to be very spicy… 

**FOMC**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ie86w522qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d9fba64e599491ea385ea89e66369d99cc56826f

Now unless you have been living under a rock… you know that FOMC is next Wednesday May 3rd. Now we also have ADP non farm, and PMI… So lets talk about it… whats the expectation for FOMC on Wednesday? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gkh2t5i22qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0781278e3e0e36698389ed017ad133a33739e7c7

This week saw a peak expectation of at 89.1% chance of a 25bps on Wednesday… however, today with seemingly the news from FRC we saw that number drop down to 80.@ as of EOD. 

For me I am fairly confident JPOW is going to do a 25bps rate hike and I am also fairly confident that despite what happens over the weekend with FRC we are going to see him stick to the script that inflation is still too hot and has not properly come down yet, he is also going to once again re-iterate that rate cuts is NOT the base case and that the fed does NOT expect a pause by EOY. 

The question we are faced with this time… will the markets believe him or not? 

There absolutely is a base case where the market shrugs him off once again and pushes this higher until we get a true CPI rebound (possibly the following week) that then “shocks” the market. However, IF we finally see market and price this in correctly for the first time since March we might finally see not only a sell off but a sustained sell off in the markets. 

**Calendar of Events**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yynv2ry22qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=92c6e2abe32677ce67ad0d7673e0ec979aba276b

From a calendar of events stand point we have a banger of week ahead data wise… 

Monday starts us off with more PMI data, followed by Tuesday with JOLTS, then of course Wednesday is ADP, more PMI and FOMC, we immediately follow up the fireworks on Wednesday with challenger jobs, and unemployment claims, then we finish the week out with the all important unemployment rate and our first fed speaker Cook post FOMC. 

Pre Markets next week are likely to be extremely volatile and unpredictable. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/av11ere32qwa1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=05fda32e6a3911b5700d95f9054c9823de79ec4c

Alright lets get into the technical now. 

After establishing a new demand (support) yesterday at 404.3 I was wondering if we might see a push up to 414.22 to take out that demand before starting our next leg down. I did not expect us to push through that and break through 415.25 supply. We had a pretty large fight at 415.25 most of the day and for a lot of the day until the huge EOD push up it looked like that was our line in the sand. 

However, we have now found ourselves wondering if we are going to push higher through 417.03 supply or if we found ourselves back in the daily range. If we do push higher here we have a huge gap from 417.03 to 429.8 with no major levels in between. 

**SPY Weekly SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ve5mmwt32qwa1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0b4c5beecb0fccfbfaa225dfabf05998dd716c97

This is where things get a little interesting here and honestly the more I look at it the more the weekly looks like we might actually have a huge blow off top push to 427.53 before we finally come cratering down. 

Last week we put in a new supply. Doing so allowed us to come down and take out previous 409.98 supply. What is incredible and extremely unexpected is that we actually in the process of all of that turned weekly supply at 412.66 into a weekly demand now at 411.87. 

It should definitely be noted this is what I would call a “weak” demand (support), however, it is definitely not something we can ignore. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ntl1nvb42qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=00f8916e19fd456bf0a9d1795d3666be0f5cb297

Now what really is impressive here is how fast this recovered this week. Two days ago I wouldn’t have expected to close over 405.2 let alone all the way back over 415… 

As you can see we actually do find ourselves in a broad black bull channel once again and we have ourselves in a 3 day long intense red bull channel. 

When we loss 405.2 I would have expected a continuation back down to 390.1, however, we actually found ourselves bouncing aggressively off the daily 50ema and retaking the daily 8/20ema.

Looking at the weekly price action objectively here we after closing three doji candles in a row we actually just closed out a massive bearish hanging man candle… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lskbyl852qwa1.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e4ce1621050eceb24c329a7d405a025d5ad596e8

Now as you can see one could assume that this IS the top… however, that would mean that we are trading based on sound technicals and logic. Or perhaps this is a preamble to whats going to happen after FOMC. However, we definitely have to take in to consideration the fact that we did drop and bounce off the weekly 20/50ema… 

Honestly as much as I am bearish long term… it is very hard not to feel bullish looking at this here. So lets talk about it…

From a bullish stand point today we bounced off the daily 8ema and confirmed it as support today. Since we bounced back inside the 405.2 to 419.5 channel the natural upside target here should be 419.5. not only that we did close over the march 18th 415.6 candle high just barely… but in doing so we should open ourselves up for more upside. 

From a bearish stand point we are coming into the upper end of our range here and resistance where bears have their highest opportunity and chance to reject. The one thing I have noticed lately on SPY is that we go on these sell offs that then lead into massive 2 days rallies that make absolutely no sense form a technical stand point… the most recent example is March 15th/ 16th and March 2nd and 3rd.

Now the question is which case is stronger here… from a macro economical/ data stand point we should see our top here and we should start our next leg down… however, from a daily technical stand point here as long as we hold this daily 8ema honestly its very hard for me to not want to feel bullish and start looking for a rally to 420+ into FOMC. 

SPY Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 427.5  
 Demand- 411.9  
 Support- 411.6 -> 407.3 -> 404.2  
 Resistance- 416.1 -> 422

Now on futures daily supply and demand here there is no change on futures… we bounced off 4085 demand and established that two days ago and now we are attempting to push through 4178 and follow through 4198 supply. 

If we can break through 4198 supply then much like SPY we have a pretty large push up to 4310 without much levels in between. 

One thing to point out here on futures daily is the volatility (relatively speaking using an indicator) we have put in back to back high volatility bars. Now the last time we did this (put in a high volatility bar let alone more then one) was March 10th to March 20th…. We actually put 7 high volatility bars in a row in… and what happened then? Well you guess it… we put the bottom of the sell off in and then went on a month plus long rally. 

So the theory would be here with this high volatility that we are nearing the top and we should be nearing the temporary top.

Now this is where we actually find ourselves in a much different place on Futures then we do on SPY…. Futures did not establish a new demand and it also did not come down low enough to 4055 to take out previous weekly supply. 

However, this is where we have found ourselves in a massive weekly imbalance… we are seeing ourselves establishing a weekly demand and then immediately turning around to close over that weekly supply… that show an incredible imbalance that will need to be reconciled by either a massive flush back under this 4173 supply or a large enough push up towards that 4283 supply that we can turn 4173 into a demand (much like spy did).

Now on a daily stand point here for Futures we find ourselves in a place much like SPY… a massively broad 2 month long black bull channel followed by a huge extreme red bull channel. 

The question would be are we on a path up to that 4250- 4300 area or have we found ourselves actually finding the top? I hate that we are truly each day left with more questions than answers…

Futures did not quite break through the wick tops of the January/ February highs, however, we also closed out a massive hanging man bearish reversal weekly candle here too… This one was however, bullish engulfing… 

Again far more questions than true answers and sense of direction… I truly hope that FOMC provides not only direction but sense of answers and clarity.

The one question I think we ask ourselves every single day… IS the VIX broken? My answer is yes but only when it wants to be…

So lets pain the picture here… This week (and today) we got data that suggested inflation has not cooled, we got data that suggested a recession is upon us, we got data that suggested the economy remains far too strong (remember strong economy the harder and longer JPOW can rate hike), not only that we witness yet another bank (this time the 14th largest) officially go under, and we have one of the most important fed events in less than three trading days (FOMC). 

Now despite all of this… the VIX (which remembers shows you the voaltility of longer 28+ dte options) decided it was going to not only put in a 52 week low but an almost 18 month LOW for the VIX… 

From low to high over the last 3 days the VIX has unwound nearly 20%. Absolutely insane when you look at what is coming up over the next two weeks and not only that everything we got data wise this week.

Truly I just can not for the life of me fathom why the VIX is behaving like this and I truly can not really imagine a world where no one feels the need to put on long term downside protection… 

I mean look at that massive spike in March with the last time we got the same banking information… why are we not seeing a similair reaction?

Todays trading started out much like yesterday but honestly it was even more extreme during opening hour… I truly cant remember the last time we ran $3 up during opening hour let alone during the first 30 minutes of the day. 

Thankfully I was able to make some money on some scalps and then it pretty much all went down hill from there… we had that huge reaction to the FRC data and that’s where everything went wonky… market couldn’t decide if we were going to melt down like march or if we were going to ATH… after getting absolutely massacred I was able to crawl back to some decent profits to close out the day. 

I think what is most frustrating over the last two weeks is that I have had incredibly profitable Monday, Tuesday and Wednesdays and then end up unfortunately giving back some of it on Thursdays and Fridays. 

One interesting trend that I am monitoring on my weekly logs is that for 2023 my win rate has dropped almost 20-30% since January, however, despite a rough February my profitability remains the same. The question would be why? One thing that I have noticed lately over the last 2-3 weeks is that I am allowing myself to take far more entries then every before (or perhaps im just getting more entries). I have noticed that if the entry criteria is there then I take the play… however, sometimes that obviously doesn’t play out. One thing I have also noticed is that I am far quicker to stop myself out then ever before. All in all a good week of trading and profits though. On to the next!",2023-04-29

"Last week I said I was still bullish on SPY and that I did think we would see 430… I still feel that way and I think that we are seeing the pullback before the next move up playing out here perfectly. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xpnzrqlx7n1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2821f35f8cce300355daa5abffb60b591168d171

Before the bears absolutely took the bulls by the horn middle of day and plunged them off the cliff… I was targeting two major support areas on SPY and QQQ for tomorrow… while anyone who follows me know on a daily time frame my timing may not always be perfect (as I expected tomorrow) my levels almost always play out… Being that these levels played out a day early for me… I actually am expecting a bounce tomorrow… or by EOW minimally. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hxa53g2y7n1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6d9edd08661ed0bfc105f93d96e8f07a70d2aec7

From a supply and demand standpoint we had a huge day… so we put in a new supply (resistance) at 418.78. This now makes this 418.78 to 419.5 a major supply and resistance area. In doing this we have no retraced all the way back down to take out 416.75, 415.58 and 413.91… we did fall just shy of touching 413.05 supply just under the daily 20ema though. 

Taking out the daily 8ema is a bearish omen for the markets, however, bouncing off the 20ema like we did today is bullish in nature. This should be seen as a support bounce rather than a bigger sell off for now. 

However, IF we continue to leg down tomorrow and close a candle under 413.05 supply which is the daily 20ema then I actually might be more apt for a that we see a retrace back to 410.2 demand (Support) before we bounce. This might be an example of being a day early for the bounce. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4anbi8ly7n1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f3c4ca0c83f33def5b21cab77bf7dc98aecc1d49

Bears took us all the way down through the daily 8ema and bounced us right off that red support line at 413.7. As of now that should still be considered support until proven other wise. 

Support for tomorrow of that line will be 414.6 meaning bulls need a small gap up overnight in order to reconfirm and hold that support with hopes of a push up to the 417/418 area. 

Now if this is the next leg down what bears need to do is break through 414.6 support and most importantly break under the daily 20ema and close a candle below it… If you remember we traded in that 410.2 to 413.9 range for almost 3 weeks before we finally broke out to 420… this actually is a back test of that support of that range. This is the bulls attempt to turn previous resistance into support.

Failing to do that would result in a retrace back to the 410 range. To really sell this market off bears need a closure under 410.2. That 410.2 level is our daily demand so that likely would be a major support bounce area for bulls. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 413 -> 418.8  
 Demand- 410.2  
 Support- 414.1 -> 412.3 -> 410.2  
 Resistance- 417.1 -> 418.6

Nearly identical movement from futes today setting a new supply at 4208. In doing this we would have expected the move down to the 4149/4143 supply area. We did come down and perfectly bounced off 4153. As of right now that is major support to watch. 

There is a chance overnight bears get this to 4149 to take out that supply but from here I expect a bounce off the daily 20ema. 

If bears continue their sell off though the biggest support will come at the 4127 demand.

Futures did not quite breakdown and touch that red support line that SPY did today. However, Futures did come down and perfectly back test and bounce off 4153 support form the previous 4122 to 4153 channel. 

We also are setting up to close exactly on the daily 20ema which would favor a possible double bottom support bounce and move back up. 

The most probable play out here is a double bottom off 4158 that leads to a move back up to the 4172 to 4188 area. 

However, if bears manage to break this down further then support is at 4125 if we see back to back selling off happen. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4149 -> 4208  
 Demand- 4128 -> 4198  
 Support- 4158 -> 4125  
 Resistance- 4172 -> 4189

**QQQ Supply and Demand DAILY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/de7nq8zz7n1b1.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7e02e2c989bddab9be571556c6bab5d1e126b1a2

I said last week I was looking for a possible sell off back to the daily 8ema being that QQQ is in extreme bull momentum in order to find an opportunity for a long entry. We are looking to be getting just that. 

The daily officially turned 337.63 into a new supply… In doing so we come down and take out 337.29 and 333.11 supply. Now we do have another supply left down below at 326.82 but that is at the daily 20ema. That would be a larger sell off and with us being in extreme bull momentum I would be very surprised to see that move happen (not that it cant happen though). 

I will be looking for the bulls to bounce off the daily 8ema tomorrow and look for a run back to the 336.37 demand area. 

However, If this sell off continues then are most probable sell off target is that 326.82 supply which is also the daily 20ema. 325-326 is a pretty strong demand (Support) area that we would need more momentum to break through. 

QQQ Daily Levels  
 Supply- 337.6 -> 326.82 -> 322.31  
 Demand- 336.37 -> 325.99 -> 324.99

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/elwg2ng08n1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=061adc87a00ef65fe92175bac8500ded2416b1ea

The VIX actually had a really nice breakout today and after bouncing off the 16 support area 3 days ago now this is now retesting critical resistance at 18.86. IF the bears (spy) can close the VIX over 18.86 and target 20.08 then I would believe in a bigger sell off on SPY happening. However, this is a probable rejection area for the VIX. Even if the VIX gets to 20.08 we still honestly are more likely to reject then we are to sell off…

There just isn’t any real momentum to the downside and even watching the intraday movement today the dip continues to get bought. 

With no debt ceiling talks till tomorrow minimum and FOMC minutes at 2pm we likely are to return to a slightly bullish narrative. There is a chance the market could bearishly take what JPOW had to say at FOMC but historically they usually receive FOMC minutes well not poorly.

Yellen is scheduled to talk at 1005am though so that could be a true wildcard. Tomorrow with Yellen and FOMC minutes is likely to be very volatile.

I really struggled this morning in that very tight range and chop… just seemed like premiums weren’t paying out for the move that was happening. However, was really able to capitalize on that mid day sell off and overall had a great day trading. Intraday secured another weeks of profit goal. Currently even if my QQQ and SPY Call lottos go to zero tomorrow I have officially secured 2.5x my weekly profit goal… if they don’t go to zero tomorrow then im sitting at 3x weekly profits goal. 

Currently assuming my week ends profitable this will be my 8th green week in a row… that makes it tied for my second longest win streak in a row… my longest current win streak (since I have started documenting the way I do now… remember I used to work full time as a nurse and just traded in my off times) is 10 weeks in a row of green. 

Just for transparency my longest red streak is 4 weeks in a row.",2023-05-23

"Bears got squeezed a bit after going over the feb highs, but for sure reset their shorts. 

Divergences keep getting wider on a laundry list of things as well, including but not limited to DXY, yields, copper, lumber, HYG and overall available liquidity. 

The tech stocks that have been pushing us higher so far would need to go past their ATHs OR get more names to participate for a push to 4300. Which is entirely possible (though unlikely). 

This isn't considering the massive liquidity drain we're about to see when the debit limit gets raised & a trillion dollars gets sucked out of the market.

Your levels are amazing, but realistically I think risk right now is to the downside.",2023-05-23
"I gotta disagree. In 2008 sterns fell within days of SVB failing in March of 2023. Then there was a random rally once fear subsided until the last week of May. 

Not to say that history is always the same but it’s curious. And QQQ has an RSI hovering at overbought and NVDA up 180% since October lows. I think it’s the next leg down.

Not to mention debt ceiling, student debt around the corner, etc.",2023-05-23
"Excellent TA per usual, however we have a lot of potentially market moving data in the coming weeks that could grab the bulls by the horns and cut their balls off at the same time.  We have FOMC minutes tomorrow which is going to give the market another indication that no rate cuts are coming, we have jobless Thursday and PCE Friday.  I don’t see a case for a bullish PCE print.  We have default fears as well for the coming weeks.  I’d like to see a bounce coming into PCE since it’ll just make outs cheaper.  NFA my port is down 80 percent since 2020 cuz I’m a 🌈 🐻.",2023-05-23

The whole reason why the market is higher in the first place, it's all because of selected few tech stocks. If we see more correction on these, we go lower. Just look at what rest of the sectors are doing. They're not doing so good btw, small caps, retails, and all, getting crushed. Even oil, just started rebounding being defensive and all.",2023-05-23
"I’m actually starting to prefer the short side trades for this week. Momentum is actually starting to pick up to the short side in my opinion. 

I can see us ending at $409 on the spy EOW before a meaningful bounce. It’s a sideways market, no one is expecting it to go anywhere so I can see us go to the lower range.",2023-05-23

As suggested by the historical charts I looked at, it’s uptrend yesterday possibly predicted today’s SPX direction.

50 BPS Hike… the nail in the bear coffin… 2-16-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,2023-02-16
"note- MODS reposted due to my chart on the VIX having a banned ticker in it... forgot to crop it out this time. i wasnt mentioning banned ticker its just the way tradingview displays the VIX for some reason... 

&#x200B;

So this morning as I said we had PPI and jobs data and there was a chance for quite the negative reaction. Well as you see below that data came in VERY HOT. PPI MoM went from -0.4% to 0.7%+ that is one hell of a rebound! 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6y13euelymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=074aab4603aac6ebb22c8742d06ee325a9a7b1ae

Now add what FOMC said about numerous rate hikes and CPI not being under control, CPI coming in over consensus and showing that the decline is slowing AND factor in PPI now and we finally might see the wind taken out of the bulls sail… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/srxx5orlymia1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b47cfba028b2d0d4685bf6893714f526afded492

Something I don’t talk about much because honestly I am just not well versed enough in it to explain well enough is that bonds and equities have NOT been behaving correctly. We have been seeing this whole rally the 2, and 10yr yields massively rally along with DXY while you guessed it… SPY rallied too… those two should not really be doing that at all.. 

Now something that happened yesterday and post CPI is that the peak fed funds rate expectation has steadily rose this weak but the markets did not negatively react to that either. 

We might finally be seeing… that market reaction. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5xzmx6mymia1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f8baa7a27a6d38e1a843f4a4d516abece0d69f66

Now here is something very interesting to think about… We have been under this impression that we are going to continue to see 25bps hike rates until we finally get to the “end” however, today for the first time the idea of 50bps was introduced by two fed members. Now granted JPOW himself has not said he would do a 50bps hike but there is no doubt that he isnt done with rate hikes…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eabedxkmymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a6f5d020f5548567d41718adf38bf2c1c557bff

Taking a look at the CME expected BPS hike for March meeting it has actually rose to 18.1% from about 12% this morning. What actually is more impressive about this is that last meeting a 50bps wasn’t even in question. 

So the question now remains… did the market finally put a nail in the bears coffins? Is this market FINALLY going to accept the fact that inflation is not over, and that we are not going back to ATH and that the market is actually not in a good place? IS this finally the end of this insane bully rally we have been on for almost 2 months now? We will find out tomorrow…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wjcqp88nymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=59b7ae7f496feebbc3ad9b163d0f129fdce9f07d

Now we have seen this time and time again where we break down and test the 20ema then bounce. However, this time really is quite different… we are actually seeing this as a break through of this bull support (again) and this also at the same time is a rejection of the daily 8ema. 

Now this long wicked candle here is not the most ideal candle for downside continuation but it can be a continuation candle. 

The biggest thing I want to note here is that we did clsoe under that key 408.8 support that most of this consolidation has happened in. With that breakdown it would be natural to assume that we touch 405.3 support tomorrow. 

405.3 still remains critical support. If we see that level broken tomorrow there is a very high probability that this rally is going to see an abrupt end and we could be looking at the 390-400 area by end of next week. 

Key SPY Support- 405.3 -> 402.9 -> 400.8

Key SPY Resistace- 408.8 -> 410.2 -> 414.1

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nypazjonymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=859d2154628f7dc723c12eeacaeab3c350e3f27c

Futures in my opinion is far more bearish then SPY. Something else that is very interesting to me here on futures is the fact that for probably the last 3-4 days if not longer futures has (as evidence by these lower wicks) been very red after hours and has seen major reallys intraday. Now that we finally (maybe) have a true reason to sell and futures already has been in sell mode.. I am very curious to see where futures is going to take us overnight. 

Futures here we also broke the bull channel support with a massive double top off of 4160. With that rejection there and losing the daily 8ema we are in store for a bigger support test. If we happen to lose that support this is going to see an even large sell off. 

What I am watchign for here is this key 4095 support. I will be very curious to see where futures closes here at 5pm. If it drops and closes under 4095 that is even more bearish and really would open the idea for a bigger dump tomorrow. 

The big level here is the daily 20ema at 4093. If we lose that and especially clsoe under that we are likely in store for a continuaton sell off next week. 

Key Futures support- 4095 -> 4085 -> 4040 -> 4030 

Key Futures resistance- 4122 -> 4160

&#x200B;

Tesla caught a really bad news day today and we might perhaps also finally be seeing the end of this rally. 

We have not only a bad news day for Tesla but with SPY selling off AND back to back rejections off the daily 200ema at that critical 215 level I would nto be surprised to see a bigger sell off tomorrow. 

Tesla is now at a test of its daily 8ema and very well could find itself testing the daily 20ema down near 184 tomorrow or early next week. 

One thing to keep in mind here though is that tesla IS still in its bull channel. Realistically until we break that support it is only speculation on whether we are going to see a further sell off on tesla or not…

However, breaking below that going into next week could set up a very nice short opportunity especially If the overall markets are on board too. 

Key Tesla Support- 202 -> 196.8 -> 191.8 -> 183.6

Key Tesla resistance- 211 -> 215 -> 219.2

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xgkubrppymia1.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89008e5b64816fb52f03784415cae3924e477001

The VIX just managed to close a huge 10.65% green day today… this is the biggest move up on the VIX since December 22nd(9.57%+) and December 12th (9.6%+). 

This is the first 10% green close on the VIX since September 13th which was a 14.33% green day. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/femcobhqymia1.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=08f7b44489b39e3a606dc8981ad8e136ebd92cb4

With the VIX double bottoming perfectly off 18.2 and closing back over 19.7 we could be looking at an even bigger push up into the 21-22 area tomorrow. 

Interestingly enough tomorrow is monthly OPEX and we have a really nice max pain down at that critical 405 support area. Earlier in the day when we were near 414 it seemed like a dream that we would touch 405 tomorrow and I would never take a trade strictly based off max pain but the chances of touching 405 tomorrow has significantly increased.

One kind of interesting data point for tomorrow is the fact that the put call ratio is 2.72 for tomorrow… that is about the highest PC I have seen in weeks on SPY. 

I wouldn’t be surprised to see a bigger dump tomorrow and we could even end up with a bigger EOD rally too with all that put OI coming off the books… 

Tomorrow could be one extremely volatile day…

After a pretty crappy three days of trading this week I was very happy to close out a green day… sure its not a huge green day and sure its still a red week but going 3 for 4 today was a good day for me. No complaints at all. 

Interestingly enough I took the first two trades before 1030 am and didn’t take that last one until 1pm. I just as much as I knew it was a buy the dip day there just was zero movement. 

Pretty much from 11am until 1215pm it was untradable and then we were looking for that bigger EOD bounce after Biden briefed us on aliens and well that never came. I have a pretty hard fast rule of Not trading power hour… have been burnt WAY too many times and was happy to sit it out even though I would have liked to have entered a put. 

I did take a put end of date on futures that I just closed out a 20.3%... will include that in tomorows log as that was technically a swing play and closed after markets closed at 415pm for the day. 

Overall tomorrow is Friday and it should be a wild end to the week. 

To me… a closure under 408.8 is very bearish for next week and I honestly wouldn’t be surprised to see a bigger sell off next week. 

If by some chance the bulls can once again buy the dip and put this back over 410 we might see some upside next week or find ourselves once again in another sideways week.",2023-02-16
"When you say put a nail in the coffin I think you mean the bull’s coffin not the bears? Cocaine bear may just be getting started! This market has been delusional but I’ve been very hesitant to take a larger put position after getting just demolished after the October cpi report. This actually seemed like it might be sinking in that terminal rates may go to 6+ and that dot plot in March could be another shot for CCB (cocaine bear) 

Great analysis as always and looking to see how Tesla and VIX react tomorrow especially.",2023-02-16
"I see one more day of fucking over put buyers. I expect SPY to open around 406, then another patented what the hell bounce to 409-410 to trap the put buyers at open, then a rejection to close between 406-407 to fuck over the call buyers. Next week we drop.",2023-02-17

"If tomorrow is not red and not the beginning of a new down trend, I don't think we ever gonna have a strong sell off again until next earning season at least. The market is on drug lately, every risky company (companies that not profitable) is getting pump like crazy. 

There are some weird things going lately for sure... from cpi before and ppi morning today, it's just weird...",2023-02-16
"Bond and stocks only in opposite direction in absence of monetary policy. For the past 2~3momth the market was pricing in a drop in inflation, coupled by a ease in rates and therefore increased liquidity from the fed - this is very bullish and the market rallied. You also can see similar effect during the bear market last year, as well as during covid crash.

with how hot PPI came in the expectation has somewhat reversed, and now bonds and stock moves hand-in-hand again. IMO theres some very interesting trades to make here, I tried shorting bonds as a hedge at the begining of last year and it worked out well at the time, though eventually i went back to stocks",2023-02-16
"After all that I have seen from this fed I dont think JPOW will do a 50 bps hike even though it would be the right thing to do. I dont see a massive market dump like we have seen in the past, we probably hover between 395 - 415 till the D-day. Earnings were for most part better than expected and there is not much real case for a recession right now.",2023-02-17

"Market analysis and speculations are very similar to mine.  As much as I like seeing my bias confirmed, the one thing I believe could help the market rebound tomorrow is the enormous number of puts expiring, as was mentioned.  We'll see what the trends look like tomorrow, but my gut tells me the real bleeding will start next week.",2023-02-17

"Remember I told you we'd sell into OPEX? Well, we kinda did, but this is not the kind of price action that's convincing to me as a bear. Wednesday should have been a deep red day, supportive flows were muted that day, but yet, no drop. Today there should not have been a huge intraday bounce today, the price action is showing that there is still too much dumbfuck money lying around ready to buy the dip. The thing is that big money HAS covered their shorts, but they still HAVE NOT chased the rally. Won't be surprised if we hit 400, only for them to ""buy the dip"" in huge volume.

Crashes only usually happen after a blow off top, where big money is 100% invested, and we're just not there yet. Unfortunately, I think the drill will be delayed. 

If bears cannot take us into deep negative gamma by next week, they're fucked, as this window of weakness is very small. Consolidation instead of drilling next week will mean another leg up.

"Today for me sucked because of carelessness, tried to play a rejection off that 409.5 level around 10 and managed to instead time my buy right before we blew threw it and started our rally that lasted until Bullard. Wouldn’t have been terrible but when we almost immediately came back down below for a minute I was emotionally trading and took it as a sign of a false breakout instead of it being SPY retesting 409.5 to establish support. Held the puts until they were down 25% before cutting them and as a final f.u. I got an awful fill and managed to knock out my gains from the last week. 

Thinking we get one last retest of 408.8 and maybe also that 409.5 area tomorrow. Do agree now that we closed below those levels we should see 405 tomorrow, and Max Pain makes me even more confident that we will, so my plan is to see where we open and play short dated ~407P (but not 0DTE) opened around 10-10:30. All relevant scheduled events I can find will be over by then and I think we might finally get a nice red trend day into that level.",2023-02-16

General consensus seems to be the “mother of all crashes” occurs Q1 2023, and that we Santa Rally into the new year - I think that’s too convenient a narrative, and we’re peaking as early as tomorrow, JPOW has an event lined up for 30th November where he will once again murder bulls.",2022-11-24

December you go long.  Simple.  80% of the time, you are going to be right.  They even tell us at work.  Its a thing, we will typically add to our undervalued positions for our portfolios.  If you are trying to short the market during december, you are playing on the wrong side.  Sure you can capture some relief dips.  But just look for demand zones, and go long and make money.

FED raising interest rates and how much SPY climbed its almost too good to be true to believe it’s going to hit ATH and therefore I want to Yolo puts 

However most people live by SPY hitting ATH, respectively so due to its climb this month 

So what are you regards doing? P or C",2023-04-16

"I’d put my vote on puts as well. 

Honestly looking at TA (yea I’m a TA guy stfu) it’s hitting above its POC but it’s not been able to go above its VAH. Noting that I believe we’ll be heading back down to its POC. As an added bonus it’s looking predicted that the S&P is going to experience some losses on earnings this weeks to add fuel to the downward action.

Now I have a theory… and its definitely a theory but if you stay with me here you may see where im going with this… 

Lets think about what we have coming up over the next two weeks… FOMC next week followed by CPI the following week. 

Now this is gonna be a long winded message and if you just want the TA skip below. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ljk3avziwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c35e0e96ae160b5cb224d9d4049c3345df7df3d1

This is from the CMEgroup which many say to be the most accurate representation of future fed funds rates… 

Lets take a look at what I highlighted here… current fed funds rate is 475-500 and by new week that will as of right now 90% chance be 500-525… 

What I want to point out here is that we actually just with that GDP data saw a huge shift in the forecasted market. Now look at what happened over night… we went from a 26% chance of 450-475 rate/ 40.2% chance of 425-450 rate to currently now a 48% chance of 450-475 and 30.2% chance of 425-450…

What does this mean? This means that we actually just saw over night the market go from pricing in 75bps of rate CUTS by the end of the year to now only pricing in 50 bps of rate CUTS by the end of year… 

Now last time I checked the market has always seen rate cuts as bullish and rate hikes as bearish… actually what is even more impressive is that over the last month we went from an expected 35.9% chance of 400-425 fed funds rate EOY (aka 100bps of rate CUTS) to where we currently are as mentioned ago… that means FINALLY the market is actually starting to believe jpow… 

Now this is where im pure speculating and spit balling my theory here… what if markets really didn’t believe JPOW last fomc? What if we ran up in hopes that JPOW was wrong and that we would actually cut 100bps… well in less than a week JPOW is going to stand up there and tell the markets “im hiking 25bps and once again as I said last meeting our base case is NO rate CUTS this year.” Now this time markets are going to start to believe him… 

Then what happens next? Well we get CPI and boy do I think we get some CPI fireworks… look at the price of OIL alone and the fact that current forecasts are for an unchanged YOY CPI/ CORE. Why does that matter? Well after 9 consecutive months of downward trending CPI we finally are about to stall/ rebound. What is that going to do? Well that is going to cause even more panic… why? Simple… JPOW absolutely can not (outside of an actual black swan market crash) stop rate hikes if inflation rebounds or even just slows its downward trend. 

When inflation is unchanged or more likely rebounds on May 10th markets gonna panic… but I think they already know this… they are going to have to with no choice price in even less rate cuts by EOY if not more rate HIKES by EOY… 

So the question would be why did SPY just put in the biggest green day in over 3 months on seemingly extremely bearish new that is staring us down right now? Its simple… market needs exit liquidity… Today is going to be the highest volume bull day since March 31st. In my opinion and theory markets know May is going to be a very bearish month and that we are going to see a true drop (think 380-390)… right now we are seeing this push back up into the consolidation range for a few reasons… 1. Burn as many people already short (remember market is apparently the most net short since 2008) before the drop happens. 2. Big money needs to exit their longs and shares that they bought from 410-418 and 3. Big money is trying to get the best price they can on shorts. 

In no way should the VIX have dropped nearly 10% on the data and news we got this morning and not with what the market priced in with the fed funds rate… This is a fake rally in my opinion. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/144zb3ojwhwa1.png?width=695&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d0ab5ac4958689ba6039f3656d548d1af6ee2878

From a supply and demand stand point we had a pretty killer and wild day… We had a lot of changes… 

We officially established a new demand (support) at 404.3 and in doing do pushed up to take our 406.74 and 409.18 demand. 

In addition we pushed up all the way to 412.62 supply and had a pretty solid rejection off of it. 

I see two scenarios playing out here… first scenario is that tomorrow we will push up to touch 414.22 demand (to take it out) but close back under 412.62 which should reconfirm that level as supply (resistance) that would then pave way for a push back to 404.3 demand and possibly down to 399.07 supply next week. Or the second scenario would be that we just immediately turn around and sell off back under the daily 8/20ema tomorrow which most likely would result in 412.62 being reconfirmed as supply (resistance) 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

Now on SPY here price action wise this was quite the reversal and really did put a stop to the bears right in their tracks… The biggest and most bullish thing I see here is that we came up and retook the daily 8 and 20ema… While it is possible we could immediately double top tomorrow and drop back under the daily 8ema by EOD… more likely than not this shows a pattern of continuation to the upside for tomorrow. 

Looking at this realistically we have now established a new range of 404.3 to 415.6. Upside should continue to be limited right around the 414 to 416 area. 

&#x200B;

We do get some more data in the morning which will be interesting to watch play out and how markets receive this data…. I honestly don’t have a high sense of direction for tomorrow but I wouldn’t be surprised to see an attempt to touch and take out that 414.22 demand we left above… doing so really would open up a lot more down side possibilities. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 412.6 -> 415.4  
 Demand- 414.2  
 Support- 410.6 -> 409.2 -> 406.9  
 Resistance- 412.6 -> 414.1 -> 415.2

Futures daily also had some re-arranging today. We put in a new demand (support) at 4085 and have push up to take out 4117 demand. We now are currently sitting just over 4158 supply with the next supply at 4178 and 4198. 

Much of the same here on Futures as SPY I do see a case to immediately turn around to reconfirm 4158 as supply (resistance) with a double top drop…. But I also see a case for push back up to 4178/4198 supplies first before we eventually push back down to 4085 demand and eventually 4040/4055 supply.

Much of the same here we came down here and double bottomed nicely off 4085. In doing so we retook the daily 8/ 20ema and retook critical level of 4095. 

With the current down trend broken we should expect this 4085 to 4178 range to be our new range until fomc or something else breaks that trend. As of right now the closer we get to 4178 the more bearish we should find ourselves. 

I do believe we will continue this run up tomorrow but I believe we are just being presented and even better short opportunity for summer time.

Futures Daily Level  
 Supply- 4158 -> 4178  
 Demand- 4085  
 Support- 4138 -> 4110 -> 4095  
 Resistance- 4158 -> 4178

**VIX1D**

The VIX1D actually gets its own section today because it was so intriguing to me as while we only have now 4 total days of data… todays the first day that didn’t make sense to me. 

The VIX1D, or the 1-Day Volatility Index, measures expected volatility in the S&P 500 Index for the current trading day.Taking an aggregated measurement of weighted prices across one- and zero-day P.M. settled SPX option expirations, the VIX1D calculates its value of expected volatility, according to the Cboe’s press release. Simply put, the VIX1D reflects the midpoint values of weekly SPX put and call prices for today and the next day in real-time. 

So that’s the definition of apparently what the VIX1D measures.. now lets look at the VIX1D today… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kda0aewlwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2f1c5d392b3f548a99e998dc001fa372e0c0ebe6

This is VIX1D on a 5min chart with HA candles on the left and standard candles on the right… what does this price action show all day? Well it showed that the VIX1D had a MASSIVE drop over night (at open… remember vix1d closes at 415pm and opens at 930am which I still think it should be the same hours as the regular VIX). After the massive gap down what did it to? It rose all day long and aggressively rose all day long.

Now why is that odd? Well lets think about this the same way we think about the regular VIX… if we watched the VIX gap down about 30% at open only to close up 11.29% by the EOD what would you expect the price of SPY to do? You would 100% expect it to have a massive drop. And if it didn’t what would you expect? Well you would expect that there is a massive imbalance somewhere and that something isn’t correlating correctly…

So I see two ways this fixes itself… we either 1. Have a massive melt down on SPY tomorrow to catch up to VIX1d or 2. We have a massive correction to the downside on VIX1D which then causes an even bigger rally on SPY tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/67049ibmwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=35e3cdcbb103f75f9abab9cfb3e5c9e221bec71b

Currently I am in the process of tracking VIX1D and finding a correlation… I am not using Mondays data as its not helpful for me and my analysis so I only have 2 days of data… so far what I have seen is that IF the 4pm to 415pm move on VIX1D is down (so the 415pm close is lower than 4pm opening on candle) SPY will open green the next day (no correlation on how green yet). I also see a correlation that IF the VIX1D closes HIGHER the day before then the next day SPY CLOSES red… IF the VIX1D closes LOWER than the day before then the next day SPY CLOSES Green… 

So if we look at this trend and data so far… we should see a green open on SPY followed by a red close… now of course two days of data is hardly anything to take a trade off but I continue to track this and plan to track this for the foreseeable future and analyze IF we can make a predictive guess…

But I share this data now because if that’s the case and data holds true we are actually setting up for a massive red day tomorrow with how aggressive the VIX1D rallied. 

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7ecgugpmwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6af05cf1b69e9c6c89386be4d6f68ea716324554

Now this is where I continue to be a little dumbfounded… I see zero basis for why the VIX would be down 9.66% today based on the GDP data and the change in the EOY fed funds rate expectations… We should have seen a continuation on the VIX to the upside… however, that’s not what we got and we now find ourselves back in this red channel from 15.05 to 17.1. 

This also brings us back under the daily 8ema/ 20ema. 

Now the question and the data I will be taking from today is does the VIX outweigh price action on SPY compared to VIX1D… as in does a massive red day on VIX mean more than a massive green day on VIX1D. 

I also can not for the life of me understand while the VIX would drop 9.66% (meaning there is now less 28dte+ long term puts than yesterday) when a recession is pretty much imminent and the actual chances of a fed pause grow further and further away. There is a severe imbalance here.

Today was an absolutely frustrating day… took a small loss on a meta put which im not even upset about… 

But intraday trading today was absolutely frustrating and at times senseless… It felt like almost all day we were set up for clear cut bearish movements. However, what we found was pushes to the upside just continued…. The hardest part about today was that I recognized we were in extreme bull momentum for most of the day and I even tried a few times to get in on calls (actually loss on a few or took profits too early) however the technical never set up for an entry… and by time it actually set up for a call entry it had already moved.

Today was a lesson in a few things… 1. NEVER and I mean NEVER fight extreme momentum no matter how good a play works (I struggle with this ever day like this)…. 2. We do not need to trade every single day… recognize the days that are advantageous to your strategy and capitalize on those… sit out the rest… 3. There will be days that are the exception to the rule… that doesn’t mean we change our rules to fit that day… it’s the exception not the rule. 

I am still thankfully sitting at my weekly profit goal overall right now but today took a huge chunk out of my weekly profits. Today was a frustrating day and one that you look back and say well obviously it was easy… just buy a call at hold it all day… well sure everything is easy when you look back… but for anyone who uses any sort of technical analysis or price action reading or anything outside of FOMO…. Today was anything but easy. 

Remember… tomorrows a new day and we have 252 trading days a year… we don’t have to trade every day… also have a set amount every day that if you lose $xxx then you stop for the day and come back the next day… one of the worst thing someone can do is continue to trade on a day that’s not made for their strategy and eat way and weeks or months of profit.",2023-04-27

"First of all awesome DD with great info. I agree with most of your comments however wouldn't you read that slowing GDP data (not negative) would mean the fed hikes are doing what was expected and would mean a pivot sooner? Imo that was the only reason there was a crazy amount of bulls that came out of the woodwork and bought non stop right until after the bell when Amazon reported. We broke new highs on NQ and ES after the bell.  These earnings are just more support for bullish thesis and that economy is strong even in a high inflationary environment. Hence the big move after GDP data not necessarily earnings.

Edit; Regarding VIX, we opened higher on SPX and went up the entire session so VIX closing much lower is expected. If it actually went up while market was breaking out would mean that there is large hedging against current move, which it doesn't look like was happening today.

I'm just trying to point out the other side of the coin here that we could keep going up irrationally further and not every move is a trap especially when you have tech recovering drastically.  But we can also plunge on any bad news whatsoever especially the mentioned no rate cuts this year.",2023-04-28

Markets have pricing rate cuts for a while.   Even as of a month or ago, the idea of even 1000bps cut this year wasn't completely off the table.  If fed raises rates this round another 25, I think markets puke big time.   I agree today felt like big money taking chips off the table.  

Im can't play spy right now.   I got burned all week by it.  I'm now focusing on hedging my larger positions by picking up cheap short term otm puts.   Setting up for a big down day soon and I'd like to have some cash for those days without having to sell stuff.",2023-04-28

Now the question is after the brutal bear trap yesterday… is this a bull trap in the making or is this the breakout of the range? 

Note- I am no longer including Supply and demand in my TA… as I mentioned that was an indicator that was not available to the public. I was blessed to use that indicator while I did. I am however out of my testing period of it and not able to access it anymore. I will be spending my weekend doing some extensive backtesting and revamping my indicators to fill the void of that. 

I am hoping by end of the weekend (planning to spend a sizable amount of time on this) I will have some sort of supply and demand to share with you guys. I have a few things I want to test out just need to spend the time actually testing them… just wont have the time intraweek to do that. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

https://preview.redd.it/3099h52ndg0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9f4ef2bb6bcbf04af22e5410c92a3a79717b718a

Yesterday was the ultimate bear trap in that we closed below the 7 day range of 410.9 to 413.9. However, as today would show that was clearly a bear trap and a fake break down. Now if you watched the charts intraday today you would see that from 1130a until 145pm SPY went on a massive rally of almost $4. What truly is impressive about this a few things… Apple until EOD didn’t join the rally at all, we didn’t really get any noteworthy news that would explain this run up (biden said the next talk was Sunday but gave no concrete evidence of a debt ceiling solution), the dollar AND the 10yr both rallied today. 

So the question would be was this a shorts covering/ squeeze rally or is this a sustainable rally starting here? 

The biggest thing I note here is while we did break that 410.9 to 413.9 range… we did not break through 415.9 resistance established on 4/28. Not only that but we did fill the 415.27 gap today and pretty hit a brick wall with a retrace EOD off these levels. 

Now usually I would say this is a top and a clear rejection where we should expect a retrace. However, this daily candle reminds me a lot of previous shorts covering rallies that made no sense from a technical stand point. In general these are usually two day rallies. 

For me here in order to be bullish and expect further upside (target would be 419.5+) I would want to see bulls continue this rally tomorrow and close over 415.9. 

However, there is a sizeable chance since realistically nothing has changed the last 2-3 months of trading that we actually are still in the bigger broadened 404.3 to 415.9 range. All eyes will be on 415.9 at close tomorrow. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Support- 412.3 -> 410.2 -> 408.9  
 Resistance- 415.9 -> 416.9 -> 419.5

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

Futures daily actually had the clearest lower highs trend that was going on since May 1st peak, however, today big move up went ahead and negated that. We are now seeing a massive bullish engulfing daily candle on futures. However, it has come into contract with the 4179 resistance and hard rejected. This area would be similar to that 415.9 area I mentioned. 

From here the question will be are we still trading in a bigger broad 4190 to 4075 channel or did we see a drop in order to find a new higher high? 

As of right now much like SPY I find it hard to be sustainably bullish until we see a daily closure over this 4190 resistance and top from May 1st.

If we break through that and more importantly close over it then I would start to target 4212 and 4237.

However, if this is still the broad channel 4179-4190 should hold as resistance and we should look for a retrace back to 4154 and 4125 support area. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Support- 4154 -> 4125 -> 4110  
 Resistance- 4173 -> 4179 -> 4190 -> 4212

On the VIX daily I have been watching this 16.79 to what was 17.73 channel resistance for just as long as we have been watching the channel on SPY.

The VIX daily did come up and make a nice double top rejection off 17.97 today so that now is our channel resistance. What I find most interesting is that the VIX came down and tested 16.79 support EOD and did manage to close over that level at 17.3.

As I have said for a little while now… the VIX has been pretty on point with SPY price action. If we were to see the VIX lose 16.79 support tomorrow and make a push for the 15.72 area then my anticipation would be that we do indeed break through 416 and look for 420 area… However, if the VIX can put in support here and start a push back to the high 17s or even 18s tomorrow then I would feel fairly confident that a SPY will respect this upper limit of its range with a closure under 415.9 which would then make our target once again that 411/4153 magnet area on SPY/ Futures. 

**DXY/ 10YR YIELD**

&#x200B;

I actually think what is the most interesting thing about today is the fact that the Dollar found strength once again and did push for a new recent high. In general one should not expect stocks to be rallying with the dollar… and perhaps that’s why Apple for most of the day showed the weakness it did.

Also today we saw strength return to the 10yr and it continues on its breakout channel here. 

From a correlation stand point the last time the VIX was at 16.86 was 5/12 and SPY closed at 411.59. The last time DXY was at 102.882 area was 4/3 when SPY closed at 410.95 and the last time the 10YR was at 3.577% was 5/1 when SPY closed at 415.51.

The 10YR would be pretty correlated here with SPY closing at 415.23, however, VIX and DXY would suggest that an equivalent closure at $411.27 would be more appropriate.

Overall not a bad day of trading even with my lotto swing put that closed at a full loss I was able to secure a green day today. I missed out on most of that intraday pump as it was just so wild to me that I never felt like I had a confident and non FOMO entry. Honestly that is the worst part about trading days like today for me at least when the trend is running on extreme momentum it always feels like you are entering on hope that the trend continues in your direction and that you didn’t just buy the top.",2023-05-17

Hey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.
>TL;DR: Big move up on SPY today that has bulls hopeful for a breakout of the range. VIX/ Dollar and 10yr yield all point to potential rejection off these levels. Important to see if bulls can maintain this momentum into tomorrow and close over key levels of resistance.",2023-05-17
The fact that QQQ won’t even give a tiny pullback has me confused. Looks like nothing in the world can stop it,2023-05-17
"Uptick in housing.  Stock market rally.  Unemployment falling.  Uptick in retail sales.  Core inflation not budging.  

I think JPOWs minions have been pretty clear recently that we are not at the terminal rate.  They are prepping markets for another increase imo.  

JPOW talks Friday.  Let’s see if he pulls another jacksonhole.  

They can’t have the wealth effect working against them and right now it’s working hard against them.",2023-05-17
"SPY looks like its possibly forming a right shoulder for a H&S, but Nasdaq going up in a straight line has me scratching my head. Needless to say everything still bullish. My TQQQ 29C covered calls just got blown up. Not worried though",2023-05-17
Thoughts on the VIX as we approach the supposed ‘X-date’? Seems crazy to me it’s this low.,2023-05-17
"I need NVDA to close under 292.50 by Friday or else I’m fucked.

Edit: All. i. Know. Is. Pain.",2023-05-17
"As traders we need to recognize the market conditions that we are trading in. This is a sideways market for now. Once this range breaks, trust me you will know, it can be a 5% spy move in either direction. Then you know the range has been broken. Anything else is just sideways trading.

I’m actually enjoying this action, puts one day, calls the other. But make sure to time your entries correctly. Rode the $TSLA bull train all day today. Then end of day bought puts, as bears will take their chance tomorrow. Remember we trading sideways.",2023-05-17
Still bullish tomorrow though. But I’ll lay my puts before close tomorrow.,2023-05-17
Thank you for your effort!,2023-05-17
"VIX hit 1 Hr bearish extreme momentum and never looked back. Market soared. So much correction to be had now. Tomorrow should start bloody as we retrace to necessary volatility points. 
conservative target of SPY $413.45. Full target of $411.",2023-05-17
"Passive ETF investors, momentum algos, bag holder delirium are my best guesses. That, or Jim Cramer is right about a new bull market and ATH ahead.",2023-05-17
"[Tweeted](https://twitter.com/spotgamma/status/1658877403815444486)

Someone bought a ton of 0 dte calls combined with vixpiration likely started the move up and momentum continued it.",2023-05-17
Well looks like that 415.9 was beaten pretty easy. Would be surprised if it doesn't hold and a push for 420 comes by late day.,2023-05-18
"Don't quite see a bear case anymore. Cleveland fed expecting a sharp decrease in YoY headline CPI for May which aligns with the Fed pause narrative. We all know the US is going to raise the debt ceiling. The only downside risk is the recession is worse than feared but seems like the US consumer is holding up well. Unfortunately, for a man not fully invested, I feel the bottom is well behind us and we might race up to ATH.",2023-05-17
sorry what indicator are you talking about?,2023-05-17
">It is always difficult to enter into a trade when the market is moving so quickly. However, if you have confidence in your analysis and believe that the trend will continue, then it is worth taking the risk.",2023-05-17
YoY CPI is heading below 4% in July unless you get crazy monthly inflation in May and June.,2023-05-17
I can never comprehend when people use highly specific decimal point support / resistance levels in discretionary trading tbh round numbers and the .5 decimal between them move everything due of the option expirations.,2023-05-18
Today was for the bulls,2023-05-18
So how do you feel now that we closed well and above $415.9?,2023-05-18

Today is just a fake pump for sure. Make sure to take out some loans and buy puts. We are headed lower. $SPY is headed to $200 in the coming years. Recession and inflation coming. It will take the market at least 10 years to recover. Many of us will be dead by then it’s best to just yolo puts and become billionaires.,2022-11-22

"Okay - now only risk 2% per trade.  That’s $2K YOLOs on $100k.  If you turned $2K into $100K then there’s no reason to risk more than 2% unless you want to lose it all.   If you lose 10% of your $100K then stop because you do not have an edge and just got lucky. 

If you want to start up again then risk only $500 per trade.  If you lose $5,000 then stop again.

If you want to start up again then risk only $250 per trade.  If you lose $2,500 then stop again.

"Still can’t really comprehend what happened the last two days, but I do know that I’m still trying to convince myself that I’m a professional trader when I know deep down I’m just a degenerate options gambler. (TLDR at bottom for the illiterate/lazy)

Positions: 
0 DTE TSLA Puts on last Friday at strike prices of $217.50p and $207.50p. 2k turned to 75k Friday afternoon 

This morning I decided to be semi-responsible and withdrew $40,000 and then proceeded to hammer 0DTE Spy $378c a bit too early at 10:30am. Doubled down at 11:40am, saw I was -9k about 20 minutes later as SPY broke below $376 so tripled down for a total of 390 contracts. About an hour later SPY rocketed and sold all contracts for a $35,000 profit. 

Unfortunately bought SAVA weeklies at the top and holding strong on DWAC. 

Anything is possible fellow gamblers. Godspeed

TLDR: Bought 0DTE TSLA $217.50p and $207.5p last Friday when trading at $222 and sold at $203 Friday afternoon for 75k profit.

Bought 390 SPY $378c today and sold for 35k profit

"Its actually really interesting the fact that some of these big tech companies are rallying 3-6% intraday while SPY continues to struggle… they literally are just passing the buck around until the hat finally breaks. 

We once again find ourselves in a familiar situation… a NYSE and S&p500 lead sell off into power hour without the support of tech.. followed by a coordinated TECH and VIX sell off EOD to prevent the full sell off potential… we have yet to truly see a day where tech leads the sell off and we have also yet to see a sell off that is allowed to continue into EOD. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jgsx6dld513b1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ada045191e203cb852ea0077fe1018e6e961c8e0

Honestly what I hate the most is that you cant really say this rally is fake because well its actually happening right in front of our eyes… but what we can say is that this rally isn’t as strong and isn’t as sustainable as some want us to believe. 

**DEBT CEILING** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oi4b1q1e513b1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=63d182bacf16e29f6194d20b270da67a0bb16d24

So now something I found EXTREMELY interesting and you know ill be first to admit that when it comes to stuff like this im very uneducated and just don’t understand the interworkings… but something one of the speakers said today is that basically due to the expected revenue in June that the actual debt limit and “running out of money” in June was overblown and incorrect in timing… I found that interesting… 

Now the whole thing that really matters here is that my understanding is that the vote for this debt ceiling will happen tomorrow (I tried to find a time and couldn’t find any officially listed)… however, as of right now IF these people stick to what they are saying then we actually will end up with a default. The last “official” default date I heard was june 5th. So theyd have 4 days to basically scramble and get it done… popcorn event Thursday and Friday? 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aagmcfke513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7ddd0a535dbe92ac524c68c88bb1fb5f54c17339

We did not establish a new supply today, however, we did set ourselves up put a new daily supply in tomorrow… In doing that we actually would take our 419.5 and 418.78 supplies and would put our new upside resistance and supply at 422.08.

Now we are in extremely weekly momentum so one could expect a bounce off the supply and push higher which would then establish a new demand somewhere in this 417-419 area. However, IF the debt ceiling news shakes the market enough we could see a bigger push down to 414.55 demand or even 410.2 demand (support) to retest that support first. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/idw7561f513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=81711666c3e27c5c78a4855d58e95578c54f58fa

When we look at the daily honestly this pattern of breaking out and rejecting the upside reminds me a lot of April 4th/18th and May 1st/ 19th. This structure actually looks pretty identical to May 18th and 19th. If so then we should see a rejection and actually see a retrace back to at least the daily 8 if not 20ema.

That gives us a price target of 414.5 to 416.8 for our retrace…

Now in the off chance that we continue to move higher and hold this black bull channel (which support is at 420.3 which means spy has to open green and hold green all day tomorrow)… if we hold that then our upside target is 425.78. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 418.78 -> 419.5 -> 429.68  
 Demand- 414.55 -> 410.2  
 Support- 420.2 -> 418.6 -> 417 -> 415.3  
 Resistance- 422.1 -> 425.1

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/17crlfif513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=97ba7b9ca02062d9b7a714c43b1c3778ac0af84f

On Futures it’s the same thing we did not make a new supply and actually the daily DMI on futures shows a little bit more upside to go.

Looking at this until a new supply (resistance) is officially put in this likely is a backtest and bounce off the 4209/4215 supply. However, if a red day is put in tomorrow we likely turn 4240 into a new supply which would take our 4209/4215 and that would then target a breakdown to 4156 and possible 4128 on a bigger sell off. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/12vg9uxf513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a70d0c2021fff34450671510996f4f00df9dd01e

Futures remains in its black bull channel which has a much more generous support at 4180 for tomorrow and resistance at 4261. A retest of the daily 8ema would give us a bounce near 4200 again tomorrow. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4209 -> 4215 -> 4312  
 Demand- 4156 -> 4128  
 Support- 4215 -> 4189 -> 4156  
 Resistance- 4240 -> 4260

**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/atnz9ofg513b1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=43af14edc955a951652bdd0e04774cb9f6288a99

Now on QQQ I actually really am looking for a retrace tomorrow… the daily DMI has hit overbought, and we are nearing a new supply being put in… we did come up and take our 351.57 demand today also. 

If we put a new supply in tomorrow at 352.68 then our targets would be 347.11 and potentially 337.6 if we see a bigger drop. 

However, there is a case to be made here if this keeps running that we reach 357.09 and 361.7 demand to take that demand out before we retrace. 

Honestly, from a technical stand point QQQ is so over extended it needs a pullback if bulls want any hope at 350-360s… 

The red bull support sits at 350.7 and resistance at 360 for tomorrow. 

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y7cjs7tg513b1.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=76efddb51999a4056dfcd66af09e0e956d7a9fb5

Now on the VIX we came within a few pennies of hitting that key 16.92 support before we bounced… for a while today we attempted to and intended to break back over 17.97 and hold it. However, the EOD push up on SPY was met and led by a nice VIX drop… this doji here on VIX could with the potential SPY rejection signal a nice upside VIX and downside SPY move tomorrow. 

Today was also an anomaly in that the VIX and SPY both closed green today… 

**10YR YIELD and DXY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t7aday7h513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1cb6909c7455d5f7120104481f1e474dcb979bb2

Now one thing that is very interesting to me here is the fact that DXY broke its almost month long bull channel support. However, it is holding that key 103.865 support. But with momentum to the upside breaking on DXY that actually could favor upside on SPY… the one interesting thing really is the fact that DXY rallied WITH SPY over the last month… 

The 10YR has the same trend in that it officially broke its uptrend with a rejection off of 3.813%... the key support to watch will be 3.693%.. now with the DXY I cant really wrap my head around why SPY would rally with it and drop with it… but on 10YR one could say that the 10YR rallying with SPY would be people going RISKY on and then a rejection here would be people going risk off.

This weekend I spent almost a whole half day going through all of my trades over the last month and identifying what was working and what wasn’t working the best… I came out super excited for my discovery and I did a lot of cleaning up of my charts… in doing that I actually was able to secure a massive win today… put in my full weekly profits today… “Mondays” have been extremely great to me so for the last month or so…

I actually really enjoyed trading today… as you can see there was some struggle in the morning as I kept bitting the recovery that never came (my own fault) and then mid day I struggled with the fake breakdown/ recovery and timing the breakdown… I definitely got stop loss hunted a few times today but overall a great day of trading mentally and results wise too.",2023-05-30

We just broke out of accumulation phase and made our first stage of distribution. We just went from outside liquidity range into inside liquidity range and are pretty balanced at current level but there are a few buy-side imbalances and sell side inefficiencies that need to be checked off to the downside.

"Perhaps I can offer you some insight to the confusion about DC date:

1. Originally we should have been good until Aug-Sept
2. What changed is 3 states with natural disasters had their Fed tax due date moved from April 15th to Oct 15th. They are CA, GA and TN. Of course CA generates a lot of tax
3. This one is my speculation or take if you will: 2021 generated a lot of Cap Gains because the market did well as did Crypto.

VWAP came down and is basing around 395, a key resistance level.  For bulls, this is a big area to test and try to break through tomorrow. Kill two birds with one stone.

Also, we havent tested the 200day MA yet. It is literally right on the cusp. With 5 and 50 day converging, it’s going to be a big moment for how we’ll trend for in next weeks.

We are literally sandwiched between 50 and 200ma. I think the safer play would have been to wait until after Jpow, and then buy a 30dte.

I play 0-14dtes, so my approach is a bit different, but im guessing bulls will claim 50ma, and we rally a bit until jpow in late march.",2023-03-02

"# Powell's Pause, Yellen's Warning: A Double Whammy for the Market?

**May 19th Recap**

Market participants scaled back their expectations for a June rate increase by the Federal Reserve to a mere 25%, following indications from Jerome Powell of a potential hiatus. The equity markets experienced a downturn, primarily driven by a slump in banking shares and mounting anxiety over the inability of US legislators to establish a consensus to avert a default.

The S&P 500 halted its two-day streak of gains, unable to sustain above the critical threshold of 4,200, following comments from a Republican representative suggesting a temporary halt in bipartisan discussions in Washington. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy remained silent when questioned about upcoming debt-ceiling discussions.

Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P Regional Banking exchange-traded fund, valued at $3.2 billion, saw a near 2% decline. This drop came in response to news that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had informed leaders of prominent financial institutions that further consolidations might be necessary.

# Economic Thunderstorm Brewing: Unpacking the Vital Data Releases of May 23-26

The coming week of May 23 to May 26, 2023, holds several economic data releases that can potentially impact the market. On Tuesday, May 23, preliminary readings for the S&P Global Composite, Manufacturing, and Services PMI for May will be released, with the consensus for all three at 50, 50, and 53.6, respectively, indicating a stable outlook. New Home Sales data for April is also anticipated, with a consensus estimate of 0.663 million, slightly lower than the previous month's figure.

On Wednesday, May 24, the market will closely watch the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, which provide insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.

A series of significant data will be released on Thursday, May 25, including preliminary data for the Q1 Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (expecting a 4.9% increase), Gross Domestic Product (forecasted at 1.1% annualized growth), and the GDP Price Index (forecasted at 4%). Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending May 19 are also expected, with a consensus estimate of 253,000, slightly above the previous week's number. Pending Home Sales data for April will be released, expecting a small rise of 0.2% after a significant drop in the previous month.

Finally, on Friday, May 26, the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures - Price Index for April is due, with MoM and YoY consensus estimates at 0.4% and 5%, respectively. Durable Goods Orders for April are also expected, with the market preparing for a decrease. Personal Income and Spending data for April, both estimated to rise by 0.4%, will be released as well. The week will end with the release of the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for May, a significant indicator of consumer confidence.

# SPY Technical Outlook

The technical outlook for SPY suggests a bullish bias overall. Important levels and targets have been identified for both upward and downward movements. The analysis indicates an anticipation of a minor or major pullback, with specific levels highlighted on the daily and 1-hour charts. On the 15-minute chart, a bearish bias is observed, accompanied by hidden divergence on the RSI, which indicates underlying weakness during retracements in a downtrend. Looking ahead to Monday, there is an expectation of a potential rejection at either the resistance line or the 419 level, creating a favorable opportunity to enter the market short towards the Bullish Order Block.

## Weekly Chart

Bias: Bullish

Upside Key Levels:

* The previous weekly high of 420.72.
* A small gap between 425.26 and 425.50.

Downside Key Levels:

On the 15 minute RSI, we have a hidden divergence playing out. This indicates underlying weakness and is found during retracements in a downtrend. Nice to see during price retests of previous highs.

Based on this information, I believe we will see a rejection at either the resistance line or the 419 (bullish shift) level on Monday and will give us a good opportunity to enter the market short to the Bullish Order Block.

"Well after a really nice family vacation at Disney and universal studios Orlando for a week I was extremely excited to get back into the saddle today and do some trading myself. I was still able to call out some great levels over the week while waiting in some lines but nothing better than being back in the office and making some nice gains. 

Going to have a slightly longer post here to catch up on some things that happened while I was gone… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/506xd8m18xta1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9dbc7ad1f1f2113fd57396919a27cc4aee5ccdd7

The first obviously would be CPI… CPI YoY came in bullishly as expected (very few expected anything other than that)…. But what was the true story? The true story was CORE YoY which came in at 5.6% which was 0.1% hotter than previous CORE YoY. 

Here is why CORE is important: By stripping out the volatile components of the CPI, core inflation allows us to see the broad underlying trend in consumer prices. Core inflation is often used as an indicator of the long‐term inflation trend as well as future inflation.

Now take a look at the trend on CPI YoY and CORE YoY for the last year. CPI YoY has been falling since June 2022 consistently… and actually took a 1% drop from month to month which is the largest decrease in YoY CPI since November to December which dropped 0.6%... However, take a look at CORE YoY… CORE has only been falling since September consistently. With this increase from 5.5 to 5.6% on YoY CORE we actually saw our first INCREASE in CORE YoY since September 2022. Now I actually am surprised markets have not reacted more to it than they did already… 

&#x200B;

Now not surprisingly we went from about a 50/50 chance of a pause to 79.5% chance of a 25bps…. Honestly that’s not really the main story to be talking about here… Lets talk about June 14th FOMC… why does June FOMC matter so much? Well currently there are 6 total FOMC meetings scheduled by the EOY… With 25bps expected at May 3rd… that means there are 5 meetings left… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0y479gl28xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=77a7aa9feb7b7803391d95eb03c181dd74fbff0f

Now according to the Atlanta Fed probability tracker by EOY we are expecting to be in a 425 to 450 target range…. Which means when we get our 25bps hike in May that will put the fed funds rate at 500-525…. That means currently market has about 100bps of cuts priced in by EOY…

This assumes the following schedule…

May 3rd= 25bps (500-525)  
 June 14th= Pause  
 July 26th= No bps/ hold   
 Sept 20th= (475-500  
 October 1st= (450-475)  
 December 13th= (425-450)

Now lets look at inflation… IF inflation is about to rebound and when we look at the fact that over the last oil futures are up 30% over the last month… there is a REALLY good chance that CPI is going to rebound. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4l2ltx538xta1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b81f80de0228c59937455fee4c580ac9a43fb9ac

If we get a rebound on CPI there is no way that JPOW would pause… and not only that but or those of you who forgot (and I think markets were kindly reminded Wednesday with FOMC minutes) JPOW mic dropped the markets and said that there was NO base case for rate hikes… one of the only reasons they even considered a pause and didn’t do 50bps was because of the bank run and they were afraid of breaking the market… 

Now JPOW himself and fed officially all agree as of last FOMC (which not much has changed since) that there is NO case for rate CUTS by EOY… Yet the market has priced in about 100BPS of cuts by EOY…

Very quickly here we are going to find out who is right and who is wrong… May FOMC very well may give us some insight into what JPOW is feeling… 

We are scheduled to have a CPI reading on May 10th and June 13th which means between the next two FOMCs we will get two more readings… IF any of these readings show that rebound in inflation then the markets are going to have no choice but to realize they priced this all wrong…

JPOW has to confirm this as the last rate hike (May) or we are likely to see the markets get broken over the summer when they realize the fed funds rate projection is 1000% incorrect and that we are not pausing like they decided (even though JPOW said we weren’t going to…). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m3yem2m38xta1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6114ce6f965b3edb4e46603c546e75127663096a

Looking at the calendar for next week we have really nothing notable to keep an eye on besides jobless claims Thursday (haven’t moved markets much), Friday is PMI and then a few fed speakers sprinkled throughout. 

This probably explains why Monday DTE SPX IV is currently sitting in the 8% range… I don’t know the last time I have seen IV that low over the weekend. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mad0hy248xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5ffbb3d0e6c1f109c5e64934067ba92317157343

This week did add a few new levels but surprisingly we have not taken out any old levels yet… very interesting that there is so much price action happening here in this 409 to 414 area. 

Looking at Daily here we today established a new demand (support) at 409.19 which should provide some upside potential. We actually have officially broken extreme bull momentum this week so we no longer have as strong of an upside case. 

414.13 and 415.36 supplies (resistance) have provided some hefty resistance the last two days and I would look for those levels to continue to reject us. A few things to note about SPY Daily is that volatility is picking up (which can signal an end of a trend (which currently is bull), price action on Wednesday actually signaled a bearish reversal and we lose extreme bull momentum. The only thing really left is for the IV increase on the daily time frame which would be the final confirmation of a bearish reversal pattern. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qo9iqbq48xta1.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=847e07bae7fe1910d9fc5ca445e42f353b09300a

Now the last 2 weeks (going into this week) we had see that 410 weekly supply (resistance) hold extremely well, however, we finally did poke over that and close over it this week. With that weekly closure over supply one COULD assume a run to 427.53 supply (resistance) is coming. 

However, the weekly timeframe is still attempting to establish a new supply which now would be a supply over 410 (resistance). 

I see two weekly possibility heres… first is that we turn this weekly candle into supply which means 412.63 becomes a new supply. This would allow for a retrace back under 410 to take out that supply. From there with SPY weekly NOT in extreme bull momentum we would look to 385.9 demand (support) or a new demand being established to potentially bounce us. 

Our second possibility here would be that we continue to push higher and higher and target 427.53 supply that was established back in August of 2022. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7n5f76a58xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=99ae1441e6157c703226120fb3b1b55313970109

On a daily time frame here we have a really beautiful cup and handle still attempting to play out. That upside of the cup could be the 415.1 rejection. If that is indeed the upside of the cup with a 9% low to high rise we would start to look for a 33.33% retrace to form the handle which will result in about a 3% retrace which then gives a possible downside target of 402.6. There is a potential scenario where we do run to 417.03 to form the cup which would give 405.2 as our retrace target. 

We still have our 3 gaps in the 396.5 to 404.55 range that needs to be filled also. 

We continue to bounce off the daily 8ema and continue to rise in this red bull channel. Currently support sits at 411 for Monday for that bull channel. Which means if we break under 411 then we will break this nearly month long support and should start to look for a sell off. 

One other thing to keep an eye on here is that 406.6 to 413.6 continues to be a consolidation area also and we have held that range (at close) for 10 straight trading days. Breaking out of one of these areas is likely to be a signal of direction to come. 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g8ew72w58xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9b9d483bdaff23cd0045d3de2eba2ffbad5ae661

The weekly chart here is actually a bit more intriguing as there isn’t a good sold answer of what way we are going to go… 

From a bullish stand point we continue to hold the weekly 8ema support and continued to put in a higher high and broke the breakout triangle that dates back over a year now. With that we should fully start looking for a run to 427.25 supply (resistance) that was established back in August. 

However, from a bearish stand point we perfectly double topped at 412.5 resistance that was established back in January 2023. With the long side of the wick to the upside here that could signal a likely top which would bring SPY back down next week. In addition we broke the month long red bull channel support. 

Bears will look to keep 412.5 as resistance and will look to close back under key 407.3 weekly channel support. However, bulls will look to break through 412.5 resistance and target 417 and 422. We actually have a small weekly gap DOWN from 421.22 to 419.96 from August. 

If you remember dating back a year now SPY has at max spent 4 weeks CLOSED over 407.7 and on average only CLOSES 3 weekly candles over 407.3 before it retraces back below. This week marks week 3 of closures over 407.7… 

SPY Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 410 -> 427.5  
 Demand- 385.9  
 Support- 407.3 -> 404  
 Resistance- 412.5 -> 417

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMNAD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k9nxkrk68xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47af58266f1b5e5cbd3b82123ffa57f296e265f7

Futures daily here is trying to close out a doji double top here at 4170. Futures has actually bounced off of the daily 8ema 5 out of the last 7 trading days. Futures made a new demand (support) on 4-12 at 4116 which provides the current upside push. 

With Futures no longer being in extreme bull momentum and much like SPY nearing bearish reversal conditions we should continue to look for this to be the top. We are currently trending between 4160 and 4198 supplies. IF and when we establish a new supply our downside targets will remain 4160 -> 4153 and then 4116. 

If bears can take us under 4116 there are still 3 major levels that need to be taken out down at 4055, 4040, and 4015 before Futes can not only push higher but sustain a higher push. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zfd3wt278xta1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fdcf6f6546cbca103973c3cdcbe87e0476876761

Futures weekly here shows much of the same as SPY… Showing that we barely today (despite trading under it most of the day) closed over 4149 weekly supply (resistance) and our next upside target remains 4284 is bulls can continue to push us up. However, If we are to turn 4170 into a new weekly supply our downside targets would be 4149 and then 4055.

Bulls still need to go back down and take out weekly supply at 4149 and 4055 before we can realistically push higher in a balanced manner. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yuay69i78xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f8441423edb9fd1cb210cccebe39859a8acb0946

You can see the really nice daily double top with the doji here at 4172 on Futures. This is where price action is more or less without trend as we saw much of today an aggressive sell off only to once again by EOD recover. The daily 8ema still remains key support and for the last 2 weeks was an opportunity to buy calls at every touch. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9gm6mt288xta1.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9d5ce2157c2579b08ce30946e5997b751afa6e61

From a very similar stand point here we see that futures broke through the black breakout triangle resistance however it also broke through the 4 week long bull channel support. There we a nice back test of 4095 area that did hold on futures… with a closure over 4149 (unlike spy that double topped here) the upside potential on futures remains a run to 4220. 

Futures Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 4149 -> 4284  
 Demand- 3919  
 Support- 4135 -> 4095  
 Resistance- 4172 -> 4220

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9atpzvi88xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=011cda9df12dcf328d9be79c91d55faa59cd7468

Now this is where things get a bit interesting… the VIX closed 1 penny higher than the 52 week low of 17.06. 

Something that is interesting about the VIX and anytime it touches the 17s is that usually is the local top on SPY… lets take a look at the times it has hit <$18 and what SPY did afterwards. 

Feb 2nd VIX hit a low of 17.06 (current 52 week low)… SPY the next day dumped -1.06% and that led to the current -9% 26 day drop before a bottom was put in at 380.65.

January 12th the VIX hit a low of 17.36 and the next day SPY dumped -1.38% and this led to a -11% 12 day sell off. 

January 4th the VIX bottomed at 16.34 which led to a -1.92% drop the next day and led to a -5% and 6 day sell off…

On Average the last 3 times the VIX was this low the next day SPY dropped -1.45% and over an average of 14.6 days dropped a total of -8.33%... This would give SPY a target of 380.6 by may 1st… which is almost exactly the next FOMC meeting and almost exactly the low we put in during the march sell off. 

**10YR YIELD AND DXY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fkn4dtva8xta1.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=748621cd1844abe94c9a7b414a206bd3e3168fa9

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fazgo1pc8xta1.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b554b3a611dd6b1a1b3ee4fa45fe0d750d4e5beb

Now this is something else that interestingly enough on DXY and the 10YR yield that also goes perfectly with the VIX 17.07 bounce (aka calling the bottom of VIX and Top of SPY) and goes with the possible cup and handle being formed on SPY/ futures daily. 

When we look at the last time the officially top of SPY was put in it was on February 2nd and the DXY put in a support level at 100.86 at that time. Yesterday and today the DXY bounced off these level and formed a really nice double bottom off of 100.99. 

Also taking a look at the 10YR yield generally speaking we see the rates of the 10YR rise while SPY drops… with a local bottom potentially being put in at 3.306% support last week… if the 10YR is able to push through 3.518% then our target would be 3.617% to 3.704% on the 10YR…. The last time the 10YR traded at 3.518% SPY was at 408.44 to 411.37. The last time it traded 3.617 to 3.704% SPY was trading at 380.65 to 393.45… 

While I know many people are pretty bullish right now… there are a lot of stars aligning that could provide a drop as low as 380… but more realistically I think a retest of 390 leading into the next FOMC meeting is entirely possible. 

**EARNINGS**

One other thing to keep in mind is that over the next month we are starting to come into Earnings season with banks kicking us off today already. 

Next week we can look forward to more banks on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. 

Wednesday we have Tesla. 

Thursday starts us off with TSM, more banks, and some retail starting to trickle in.

The big week for earnings will be the Week of April 24th to April 28th with Meta, AMZN, GOOG, and MSFT… with apple the following week. 

Tesla will be the key to watch Wednesday after hours to start off the earning seasons… for those of you who don’t remember… last earnings Tesla ran 33.34% intra-week and went on to run up a total of about 62% over that month. 

**WEEKLY TRADING LOG**

📷

Realistically this says weekly trading log but this is just my intraday trading log as I was gone Monday through Thursday and didn’t take any trades… I did open some 98dte (current) DTE 405p that are down about 20% right now though… 

To clarify here a SCALP for me uses the 1 minute chart primarily for entry with a few different indicators and is playing a bounce or rejection generally off the 1 minute time frame with a shorter expected hold generally holding for the full cycle of the 1min DMI. A Level to Level play for me involves the use of 15min supply and demand, ORB (opening range breakout strategy) with primarily taken entries based off the 5min and 15min candle price action with 1min help for a good entry. 

Was able to hit just over 50% of my WEEKLY goal intraday today… it was a killer morning playing some beautiful scalps that ran aggressively for me. I gave back quite a bit mid day as I still struggle finding good entries and mostly continuation from that noon to 2pm time frame much like the last few weeks of trading. 

Overall a great day of trading and for me I was so excited to get home to start trading I couldn’t be happier with todays results. Looking forward to next week trading. 

I did end up swinging some 3dte (Monday expiration) 4135P due to the fact that IV was so incredibly low (it was almost in the 7% range) when I opened them and the fact that I believe the VIX will recoil Monday with the dollar and 10YR which should provide a downside push on SPY.",2023-04-14

"Biggest short position on S&P E-Mini Futures since 2011, link below. More short than October lows, more short than COVID lows. If you're asking yourself why this market doesn't decline, it has nothing to do with bulls buying the dip. 


Instead it has to do with bears being extremely pessimistic and apocalyptically positioned that causes massive shrt squeezes every week.

Positioning is so light, so few are long, so many are short, that causes very muted declines.

CPI Prediction and Analysis…. 1-11-23 SPY and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,2023-01-11
"Twas the eve of CPI markets put in a nice low volume green day to day. Roughly its standard $4 +/- move. 

Lets take a look at my predictions for CPI. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4w0xsbxizhba1.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dcfa15af2f51c243ec2b288b92010937188dd24f

Currently I expected a bear on everything but CORE MoM. The one oddity going into this CPI is that the Cleveland fed has an oddly high MoM CPI/ CORE estimate. They are estimating about 0.5% for each. Which for CPI MoM is about 0.5% higher than Bloomberg and consensus and for CORE MoM is 0.2% higher than its estimates. The standard variance is about 0.2% however we have seen a few 0.3 to 0.5% variance outlier this year. 

In my opinion main focus is going to be on CORE YoY. As long as CORE YoY comes in lower I expect a decent green 2-2.5% green open. However, IF CORE was to come in unchanged especially with a miss on CORE MoM I would brace for a 2.5-3% red open. 

&#x200B;

Interestingly JPM is calling for a green day (85% probability) IF CPI YoY comes in below 6.6%. Currently per my estimates we have a 66% chance of CPI YoY being 6.5 to 6.6% and a 33% chance of it being 6.7%. 

JPM has weighted their probability correctly (granted their reactions usually are 100% wrong) correctly the last 3 or 4 CPIs. Will be interested to see if they are correct today. They are pricing in a much lower reaction than the least 2-3 CPIs. 

For instance December CPI their “game plan” had a 70% chance of a beat with 50% chance of a 2-3% rally and 15% chance of a 4-5% rally. In November they had waited a 65% chance of a green day with 40% chance of a 1% to 1.5% rally and a 20% chance of a 2.5% to 3.5% rally. ( I tried to find their October prediction but cant). 

This is the highest percent probability of a green reaction that JPM has given spy. The most interesting thing about tomorrow is looking at overall IV and options premiums for similar positions I played last time everything is very “cheap.” Granted last CPI we were faced with back to back CPI/ FOMC so everything was really jacked up but even compared to November a similar position for tomorrow that one would have played for Decembers is about 50-60% cheaper. IV is also about 20-30% lower than previous. The way I see it markets are NOT pricing in a huge reaction like the last few CPIs. Which is honestly surprising being that the last four CPIs average a +/- 2.6% open and all the CPIs from this year average a 1.8% +/- open. 

We are either being set up for a huge let down like May which opened at -0.02% or options are going to pay out extremely well at open tomorrow.

Gonna keep this brief as we are gonna most likely see some sort of 2-4% +/- move and we will pick up where the dust settles tomorrow. The biggest thing to note on the daily is that we have the daily 8 and 20ema crossover which is extremely bullish going forward (regardless of CPI). In addition we broke through the possible channel resistance and with a beautiful cup and handle forming, closing back within the previous 393 to 402 channel I would not be surprised to see us close well within the 400s tomorrow. My key targets are 402.3 (+1.7%) -> 405.2 (+2.4%) -> 410.3 (+3.7%). With a great market reaction to CPI tomorrow we might actually retest the resistance that markets established last CPI. The “bear market resistance” line sits at 401.5 if we break through and close over that tomorrow I would officially say the downtrend is confirmed over and that we are in either a very long consolidation (which most bear markets do see) or we are starting a VERY slow up trend (not to be confused with a bull market returning). 

Speaking of bear/ bull markets… tomorrow (or later this week/ next week) IF spy breaks back over 417.73 (5.6%+) or SPX breaks back over 4189 that effectively ends the current bear market per definition (its considered a “bull market” when the ticker moves up by more than 20%). 

While I remain fairly bullish for tomorrow and I really do think we are going to have a pretty impressive green day tomorrow (3-4%) I am cautious that we may have been led out to pasture with this one. If we were to react negatively to MoM or something else for CPI tomorrow the reaction is going to be extremely bearish. I would not be surprised to see -4 to -5% red day tomorrow if ALGOs choose to go that way. Key support I would watch at 390.1 (-1.4%) -> 382.6 (-3.3%) -> 378 (-4.5%).

381.4 is the current red bull channel support that I am watching if we do get a huge red day but hold that support we could still end up on a bigger bull move. 

The other pending question for tomorrow is can the markets actually find the strength to hold a rally intraday and after CPI?

Tesla remains an unknown. While when it broke through 123 that was extreme bullish the fact that it loss that momentum and actually ended up closed effectively on the channel resistance is not as bullish. I am relatively bullish on Tesla regardless of the market. This is the first time we have had 3 back to back closes over the daily 8ema since the beginning of December. We have not had 4 closes over the daily 8ema since the last week of October. 

Current momentum gives Tesla a push to test resistance at the daily 20ema and the broad blue bear channel support at 134.4 tomorrow (+9%). However, if we get a bad CPI it will lose this black bull channel and the daily 8ema again I would not hesitate to open some next Friday DTE puts on tesla with the likely hood we see it break $100 early next week. 

The way I see it looking at most tickers is that everyone is absolutely on an edge and tomorrow we might FINALLY get a push off or from the edge.

Relatively speaking a 2.43% green day on the VIX is pretty minimal going into CPI. The day before December CPI had a 9.6% spike for reference, however, Novembers barely spiked 2% also. The fact the VIX remained low despite an important and volatile day tomorrow is one of the main reasons we have such cheap premiums. 

I still think with algos catching onto good data the call side will pay out very well tomorrow, however if we get a deep red open and a really negative algo reaction with the VIX at 21 we should expected an easy 15-20% spike on that which is going to rocket premiums and the payouts are going to be pretty incredible. 

I will be tuned in to the charts at 830am to see what the markets bring us!

Something else to note is that we have Harker speaking who is a voting member but is considered neutral to dovish speaking at 730am before. We also have bullard who is currently seen as the most hawkish FOMC member (but non voting) speaking at 1130am and at 1240 we get Barkin who is also hawkish but non voting. 

We also get more jobless data at 830am also. There is a lot of data for algos to unpack at 830am . I still favor a bullish reaction especially if we actually do get a negative or 0% MoM CPI.

Today was a total crap shoot of trading. The premiums for 1, 2 and 6dte were so inflated cause of CPI that it took such an incredibly large move up to net any real profits. For instance a 2dte that I watched and held partially had a total $1.2 move and only saw 11% gains max. That should have been a pretty easy 25-30% win. 

The trend was also so slow and for most of the day we traded within a $2 range that we weren’t able to get the big moves we needed to spike premiums. Today in hindsight was exactly like yesterday. High volatility with selling volume in the morning followed by a recovery and a slow move green all day long. It showed tons of weakness but never could get the reversal.

"# A High Stakes Game: A.I., U.S. Debt Ceiling, and the New Market Norm

**May 27th Recap**

The stock market experienced a surge in positivity due to growing excitement over the potential of artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 rose 1.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 jumped 2.6%. Marvell Technology's announcement that their AI-driven revenue could double by 2024, coupled with Nvidia's impressive 32% increase, contributed to investor optimism.

This positive sentiment was also supported by progress in negotiating the U.S. debt ceiling and federal spending cap. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's reassurances eased concerns over the potential for a U.S. default.

As a result, investors demanded less of a premium for holding U.S. Treasury bills, which yielded under 6% on Friday. The two-year Treasury rate also decreased as market participants considered the impact of a debt agreement on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Despite the Fed's ongoing efforts to control inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index increased by 0.4% in April, surpassing expectations.

# Mark Your Calendars: Major Economic Indicators Dropping Post-Memorial Day

As the week commences on Monday, May 29, all markets will be closed in observance of Memorial Day. This holiday is a time to honor the memory of those who served in the military and gave their lives for their country. Following the Memorial Day break, financial activity will resume on Tuesday, with several key data releases on the schedule.

The day will start at 9:00 am Eastern Time with the release of the S&P Case-Shiller home price index for 20 cities for April. This index measures U.S. residential real estate prices, tracking changes in the value of residential real estate in 20 metropolitan regions across the country. The previous release showed a monthly increase of 0.4%, reflecting the housing market conditions in March. This data is essential as it provides insight into the housing sector's health, often a barometer of the economy's overall health.

At 10:00 am, the Consumer Confidence data for May will be released. This report gauges how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are about the economy shortly. It's a leading indicator for consumer spending, constituting much overall economic activity. In the previous month, the Consumer Confidence Index stood at 101.3. The median forecast for May is 99.0, indicating an expected slight decrease in consumer confidence. Any significant deviation from the forecast could have implications for financial markets, as it could indicate changes in consumer spending patterns.

Lastly, at 1:00 pm, Richmond Federal Reserve President Barkin is scheduled to speak. Investors and market participants closely watch the speeches of Federal Reserve officials, as they often provide insight into the Fed's thinking about the current state of the economy and future monetary policy decisions. As such, this speech can influence financial market sentiments and create a significant impact, depending on the comments made.

# SPY Technical Outlook

TLDR (u/[**farmtechy**](https://www.reddit.com/user/farmtechy/)**)** 

This analysis, viewed through the lens of both 4-hour and 1-hour charts, maintains a bullish bias. The 4-hour chart anticipates a swing low aligned with the 4-hour Fair Value Gap (4hFVG) alongside a significant equilibrium at 415.39. On the other hand, the 1-hour chart forecasts a swing low within the dealer range's discount zone, primarily focusing on the 1-hour Fair Value Gap (1hrFVG) and the 1-hour Order Block (1hOB). Interestingly, the 1-hour chart's RSI indicates an overbought market, having hit a triple top while the price made higher highs - a development worth tracking.

**H4 Chart**

Bias: In the context of the 4-hour chart, the present market analysis leans towards a bullish inclination, predicting a swing low on the H4 chart that aligns with the 4-hour Fair Value Gap (4hFVG). Additionally, a notable balance point is observed at the level of 415.39.

Bias: In the context of the 1-hour chart, the current market analysis exhibits a bullish tendency, forecasting a potential swing low. The focus is primarily on the 1-hour Fair Value Gap (1hrFVG) spanning from 415.90 to 416.88 and the 1-hour Order Block (1hOB) from 414.75 to 413.85. These zones fall within the current dealer range's discount zone, notably below the halfway mark of 417.38.

"DXY (U.S. Dollar Index) up: If a debt ceiling agreement is reached and it instills confidence in the market, it may lead to an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar. A resolution to the debt ceiling issue can be seen as a positive development for the country's fiscal stability, which could attract investors and strengthen the dollar.

Stocks down: The impact on stocks can be influenced by several factors. If the debt ceiling agreement involves significant spending cuts or measures that are perceived as negative for the economy, it could dampen investor sentiment and lead to a decline in stock prices. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling negotiations can create volatility in the market, which may also contribute to stock market fluctuations.

Bonds up: In times of uncertainty or when there is concern about government default, investors often seek the relative safety of bonds. If a debt ceiling agreement is reached and provides reassurance to investors, it can lead to increased demand for bonds, pushing prices up and yields down. This is because bond prices and yields have an inverse relationship—when demand for bonds increases, prices rise, and yields decrease.",2023-05-28

Pre-JPOW day… the dove or the hawk? 3-6-23 SPY/ ES Futures Daily Market Analysis,2023-03-06
"Well after two massive green days covering $10+ today started off hella strong only to find ourselves rejecting off a major 5, 15min, daily and weekly resistance at 407.3 intraday.

For those of you that don’t know JPOW testifies to congress tomorrow and Wednesday. This is a yearly thing that he has done since at least 2021. 

In 2021 we saw a red day, however, in 2022 we saw a pretty big green day putting in nearly 2%... the question we have to ask is… “will markets listen to jpow and interrupt what he is saying as hawkish finally? Or is this going to be like the last 3-4 times he spoke where the markets had blinders on?”  
 

Based on the last 2 weeks of downtrend (outside of Thursday and Friday) I honestly think markets (and more importantly the algos) are more ready to accept a hawkish JPOW and are more ready to sell off depending on what he says. 

**SPY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/si3wu0ylu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6ab668ddf7ff2144e42753f313ee8fa3f0f6ce79

Taking a look at supply and demand here on SPY daily if you remember I said one of the more short term bullish but longer term bearish scenarios was that SPY would come up and take out 405.74 demand from 2/10. We did just that today. Now what is important is what happens next. With this evening doji star pattern here and the techicals pointing to a new supply being established soon… IF spy closes below todays low there is a very good chance we are going to see this 405.74 demand turned into supply. Turning a demand into supply (resistance) is extremely bearish and would cement not only this level but would also cement a lower supply than the previous ones up in that 414-417 area. 

All eyes remain on tomorrows close to see what that technical show. If we establish this 405.2 as supply tomorrow then my ultimate target realistically is 396.5 supply from 2/24. If we can take that supply (currently support) out and turn it into a new demand or reconfirm previous demand (support) at 394.88 that would be very bullish going forward. I would 1000% play a bounce from that 395/396 area back to 405. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACITON**

Looking at the daily chart here everything is screaming put here. This evening doji star pattern is one of the highest probability setups for a put. If it wasn’t for jpow speaking tomorrow and Wednesday and my overall lack of trust in this market and the fact that pre markets have seen some incredibly volatile overnight swings… I would 1000% be in at least a 14-30dte put. I fully expect the 400 support area (which is the daily 200ema) to be retested this week when we see a structure like this. 

SPY:

Supply- 396.46 -> 414.13  
 Demand- 394.68 -> 388.52  
 Daily Support- 404.4 -> 399.7 -> 397.8  
 Daily Resistance- 405.3 -> 407.2 -> 408.2

**FUTURES SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

Now if you remember on futures last week we had taken out previous demand and now we are officially in a no mans land. We either need to find the extra strength to push to 4096 before we establish a new supply (resistance) short of that. OR we need to establish a new supply (resistance) and come take out lower supply at 4015/ 3991.

For me personally based on the technical and daily price action we should turn todays candle into a supply (resistance) here at 4055. Doing so will then open up a retrace to “take out” previous supplies at 4015 and 3990. IF we take those out and can establish a new demand before retesting 3960 then I would like a push back to 4096. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qcfyqydnu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=82c9045d96792ed6ddcd70116dab96d8101a62e1

taking a look at futures daily price action here are one could imagine the candles are similar to spy (which isn’t always the case) and we are actually seeing a pretty significant reversal candle set up here too. With the SPY and Futures daily reversal set ups I would be surprised to not see a retrace to minimally 4020 tomorrow. 4020 is currently where the daily 8, 50 and 200ema sit. However, there is a chance with JPOW speaking tomorrow that the algos could do something funky which obviously would result in a breaking of technical. 

Again if it wasn’t for JPOW I would have felt pretty darn comfortable in overnight 25-30dte puts. But little reason to take the risk. 

Futures: 

Supply- 3990 -> 4015 -> 4160  
 Demand- 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096  
 Daily support- 4050 -> 3983  
 Daily resistance- 4085 -> 4095 -> 4113

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ohkn1jou6ma1.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bce6682c02e23d6edb60b2f5bcc9af2ddddf2c47

Overall the VIX is still in a down trend here as you can see. However, it put in a really nice inside day today. Historically speaking inside days result in continuation but is not always the case. 

I mentioned on Friday that the 18.2 support touch on Friday should have resulted in a VIX bounce which is clearly did. However, that apparently did not account for the fact that SPY wouldn’t care that the VIX was green all day long too… nor would it account for the fact that yields once again were elevated again while SPY was green. 

The only thing that played correctly was that DXY was down just slightly today while SPY was green.

Absolutely a great way to start off the week! No complaints at all. I got burnt as you can see twice in calls though. The first one I stopped myself out of when we were playing around that 406.5 to 407.3 morning/ mid day chop… I entered a call on support (what I thought was) and price action broke a key level. I took my exit and then of course it pushed to HOD. Tough bounce but was the right play and the right stop loss. 

Only other loss today was a stop out when we  bounced off support and once again had a fake break down.

The morning was extremely frustrating to trade as we were seeing that VOLD was extremely bearish along with the VIX and the yields, however, SPY continued to push up. Made for some choppy trading. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p7qhh2npu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2425feb7b9e7181bf8ca9e5ec81648a6beab44ad

However, the best play of the day was the 1225am retest of 407.3 resistance. I saw it as a short opportunity and took a beautiful 9.4% win. I ended up closing for profits when we came back down and were holding 405.3 support at 1pm. I actually was looking for a bigger recovery back up to 407 again. However, EOD actually ended up being fairly bearish. 

I am bearish to neutral. If bulls take back 405.3 tomorrow then I would be bullish until we touch 4096 supply. However, I feel fairly confident unless jpow pumps us tomorrow that we establish a new supply and will push back to that 3990/4015 area this week. 

Remember after JPOW speaks we have a TON of data EOW too..",2023-03-06

"Well it would appear for now the trend of two days of shorts covering and rallying is continuing. This momentum should come to an end tomorrow if the trend holds true… we will know for sure if that happens if we close a doji tomorrow.

We surprisingly have no data tomorrow morning However we will have two fed speakers (the last of the 14 that spoke this week I believe) and then the granddad of them all… JPOW himself will be speaking at 11am regarding “Due to participate in a panel discussion titled ""Perspectives on Monetary Policy"" at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, in Washington DC.” 

Now if you know JPOW he has a history of walking up to the mic and haven’t a lasting effect on the markets… we should absolutely expect some high volatility tomorrow. The most interesting thing to note that we will hear tomorrow is whether or not JPOW expects an additional rate hike in June. Any hint at another rate hike I would suspect that we see a pretty negative reaction. However, if he hints even briefly at a pause we likely could see a huge move up. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3stmlmuosn0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89002c555ff27f78f1725149164deb38ec9dfff8

What truly is intriguing to me is that leading up to Jackson hole in August we did see a rally much like the last two days. The day before Jackson Hole closed at 419.51 and today we closed extremely close at that 419.23 level. This is the highest the markets has been in about 9 months. 

As you can see we maintain this big rising wedge with the critical resistance and pivot point of 419.5. From here the way I see it is simple… tomorrow decides whether we start a move back to 405.3 or we start our next leg up and look for the 430s for the first time in 9 months. The rising wedge resistance sits at 422.07 for tomorrow. 

From here if we can close over 419.5 then the target would be 429.7 by end of next week. However, if this 419.5 becomes a nice double top or we get a nice doji reversal then I would start to think about that magnet 410-412 range. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Support- 416.8 -> 414.9 -> 412.3  
 Resistance- 422.1 -> 425.1

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y7f2secpsn0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2c8d57e270659521bc7e6c97f865622f656b862c

Now on futures this is where we have quite a bit of a difference in trend and levels… Jackson hole for Futes was at the 4283 level. However we closed at 4212 on futes which is where we have found support and resistance numerous times over the last year. 

As of right now the black rising wedge remains in tact and tomorrows resistance for that sits at 4265. We have not on futures at least taken out the resistance area of 4215 to 4237 yet. This could provide a nice top. However, the daily candle here would suggest further upside tomorrow. The next major area of resistance that we will be looking for is the august highs around 4310 to 4395. The 4300s will remain the next target if this bullish momentum can continue. 

A backtest and confirmation of 4191 support would confirm upside momentum. That 4191 level provided resistance for a long time and bulls being able to turn that into support would be a huge win in their books. 

Daily futures Levels  
 Support- 4191 -> 4171 -> 4152  
 Resistance- 4236 -> 4280 -> 4310

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l6mfj1wpsn0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c3341d242b3ffcc4974bc29024b77a12e09b1260

Now as impressively as bullish as everybody is out there… my one little bit of hesitation on truly being bullish is the fact that the VIX is coming not major support… as you can see 16.07 was major support and now that we have breached that the next target would be 15.78. 

The one question I would ask everyone is this… Going into a major event like JPOW speaking with the VIX only 3.3% away from its 52week low is the risk to the upside or to the downside? While its obviously not impossible for bulls to have another green day to end the week and to see the VIX see off to a new 52 week low… (a negative -6.7% drop on the VIX gets us into the 14s…) I would definitely say the risk is to the downside on SPY not the upside… It will be much harder for the bulls to continue this rally with the VIX at this level. 

However, IF JPOW comes out and re-assures the markets that all is well… no recession, we might pause and that banks are super strong… well honestly that could be enough to get the VIX into its extreme reversion to mean 12-14 area that we have not seen since 2019. So ask yourself this before you fomo in at 420 and VIX 15/16… are we really in a market status and time frame like 2019? Or is this more 2020-2023? 

I think we are setting up for one amazing long put opportunity myself. I will be watching the VIX and SPY closely at EOD tomorrow for a possible 90-120dte put entry. 

**DXY and 10YR YIELD**

Honestly what truly is blowing my mind right now is the fact that the dollar and the 10yr has been rallying in sync with us…. The last time DXY was at this level was March 20th when SPY closed at 393.74 and the last time the 10YR was at this level was March 15th when SPY closed at 389.28… call it $391 average and SPY is sitting almost $30 higher then it was last time DXY/ 10YR saw these levels…

Despite the real rollercoaster of a day that SPY had I actually had a really solid trading day. This week is shaping up to be just as amazing as the last 2 weeks of trading. I still have my NVDA and TSLA puts that are absolutely worthless and even with that loss I will realize tomorrow this is going to turn out to be a great week. 

I play to trade fairly lightly once JPOW starts talking and I honestly don’t hate the idea of a straddle going into it if premiums and IV are not too outrageous. IV is pretty low for tomorrow still and only have about a $3 move priced in… now that is 150% of the priced in move almost every single day this week so realistically a $4-5 move is probable tomorrow… meaning we either close the week out near 425 or near 415…",2023-05-18

Did we just break the Trendy Range? 5-16-23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Daily Market Analysis,2023-05-16
"IT would appear for now we are still holding this critical 4131-4153 range on futures and 411.6 to 413.5 range on SPY. We continue to range… the question is with now our 7th straight day of consolidation what is the market waiting for? What is going to snap the markets out of consolidation?

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mv1i5r3l990b1.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=de49f41d2a1a9a0ff4d4065cd752c49e8daf8816

Well we are back to the road of rebalancing SPY! We put in a new supply (resistance) at 413.02 and have taken out that 411.15 supply. In doing so we now should look for the next closest demand (underneath). 404.3 to 405.06 are the closets demands and with a closure under the daily 8 and 20ema I would be looking for that area tomorrow IF we can get a bigger day of movement and get some continuation to this EOD sell off. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pxlk4ril990b1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bdd9b7cdd9c2528f04b1a9e290c75ed9ed946b61

Taking a look here at here at the daily price action we are now closed under the daily 20ema. The last support to test here would be the black rising wedge support at 409.37 for tomorrow. IF we break through that and more importantly if we close under that we should start to look for that 405.2 area. 

We also have a gap to fill from 403.74 to 408.64 that could be a target for tomorrow…

SPY has officially broken the 410.9 to 413.9 range that it has closed within for the last 7 trading days leading into today. This could finally be the break we have been looking for. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 413 -> 415.6  
 Demand- 411.6 -> 405.1  
 Support- 410.2 -> 408.9 -> 408 -> 407

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/msstcjxl990b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=507c486be7d0d014843074c9bae17ec43384f644

One of the scenarios I was looking for was the double top off 4149 to establish a new lower supply (resistance) and that actually is the scenario that played out! With this new supply at 4149 and presumably closing under 4132 demand (support) which is our main range we should look for a move lower tomorrow… we also are seeing a closure under the daily 8 and 20ema… 

Favoritism would go for a move as low as 4074 demand. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gb5rs6dm990b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3853375ace48e4a20740ed88ae025fd80ac8fec3

There is a very slim chance with this huge recoil here that futes at 5pm could close over 4131… that would negate some of this breakdown out of the range… however, presumably I do see it closing below. With the really nice double top off 4149 followed by a bearish daily engulfing candle then we should look for the black support line to be touch at 4116.

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4149 -> 4153  
 Demand- 4131 -> 4074  
 Support- 4131 -> 4110   
 Resistance- 4149 -> 4180

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hg95gkqm990b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce5c01d91eff64e79d98dad9be31176f7358d11c

Biggest thing to note here is that the VIX FINALLY broke through and CLOSED over key 17.75 resistance… this range on the VIX actually is the same range that spy has been in… 16.79 to 17.75 was the range equivalent to the 411.6 to 413.5… now that VIX closed over and SPY closed under that range the favoritism would go to further sell off on spy coordinated by VIX moving up. 

DXY did bounce today also and needs to take out that key 102.73 level… we also saw a huge breakout on the 10YR yield today too over that 3.522% and the Next major level is 3.607%. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lhqf6f4n990b1.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bc441fcb6a3c69440825b2604a5cbfd5b4d8d376

Overall a really solid day of trading.. I really killed it in the morning and then struggled in that mid day extreme chop. Overall the week is off to a great start and look to continue building the gains into the EOW… I did risk some profits on small LOTTOS over night…

I currently am swinging Tsla 160P based on the annual share holder meeting today… I also took some NVDA 287.5P and AAPL 167.5P based on their underlying supply/ demand charts. I also decided to open some swing SPY 410P.

Goal will be to close them all at open if they underlying moves how I would like. I might hold them too just depends… they are very small sized lottos about 20-25% of my normal sized position.",2023-05-16

"Stars are aligning for a further sell off.

VIX on the rise breaking through resistance, SPY breaking that support to finally drop out of that consolidation channel and closing literally $0.01 above LOD was very bearish imo.
Dollar strengthening and yields climbing too apparently.

The rally in tech still is absurd imo. Treated like a safe haven? Why would people buy into growth stocks with insane PEs in the current environment if there's a risk free yield of over 5% is beyond me.

I'm still bearish and hope my puts can climb out of the grave lol.

For Friday's expiration most of the calls are at 4150 and most of the puts are 4050 are so MM's try hit somewhere between. Perfect area is at 4130-4145. This is just based on maximum pain theory and even that it's pretty accurate it misses here and there. I expect that there is nothing happening this week and everyone waits for next week before making moves.,2023-05-16

I still remain bullish this week and bought calls on all the small caps for tomorrow. Bears took their shot last week and it’s now the bulls turn to test the upper range once again. Had an awesome day riding AMD from $99 to $103. What a beast. Now tomorrow my thesis are the small caps will rally, IWM is back on its lower range.",2023-05-16

As you can see the bank situation is far from over… last weekend we actually went into this with the same exact issue… and we were saved over the weekend and that was the 2% futures rally.. However, going into it again this weekend can the fed and the big banks save us once more? Stay tuned to find out…

As you can see next week is FOMC and as of now there is a 38.7% chance of a fed pause and a 61.3% chance of a 25bps hike… for me I don’t think that matters… I think we are pretty much guaranteed a 25bps hike… but what is more important than that? The dot plot… that dot plot is not going to look good at all.. 

With all these extra money (yes I know this isn’t QE and its not the same as jpow money printer…) but there is still almost $2 trillion extra dollars being injected into the economy right now… that is NOT going to help the fight for inflation at all.. I think JPOW is going to come off very hawkish and I would be very surprised to see him let up.

Jpow has officially found himself in the worst case scenario… he is facing a legitimate financial collapse and facing runaway inflation. He has found himself in a no win situation… something will break. And its coming quick and fast. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7fobw40b4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=910e6d496e710b8a1437e22433182d2e4ef472ed

From a daily supply and demand standpoint we are stuck between two big levels… we have our downside demand (support) at 385.87 and our upside supply (resistance) still at 405.17… the way im seeing this play out and that huge rejection off the daily 20ema yesterday with todays red inside day is that we actually are setting up for a new supply to be established at 396 on Monday. That would then open up a retest of 385.87 demand (support). 

From there we either reconfirm 385.87 as demand (support) which I find unlikely… or what I see as a higher probability is that we break through that demand and attempt to establish a new lower demand (support) somewhere between 376.67 and 385.87. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hv2dvzfb4doa1.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=73bace99925dd47a881e3a42ca4aba6202b7681c

From a weekly supply and demand stand point we actually have not quite come into any new levels. The biggest thing to note though is that this week we came down and nearly perfectly bounced off demand (support) at 382.21 that was established back in December. 

Until a new supply or demand is established the weekly does not provide enough details for a trade. However, it is clear that this double demand (support) area from 382.2 to 385.9 is extremely strong and we will need to see a pretty sizeable drop and more importantly closure below that in order to see further downside. The weekly as long as we hold 382.21 I actually do favor slight upside. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6b0hixb4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f5b4e3febbbb78030d133cc54d3bc9b75dcdc63a

from a daily price action stand point I actually am very bearish. The way I am seeing this right now is that this was a failed breakout (yesterday) and that this is a pretty massive bear flag forming. This bear flag has a target of 378. 

We have established a really large breakout/ down triangle which provides support at 388 and resistance at 393.7 on Monday. If one of these levels breaks that will be our first sign of where we are headed next. 

We did actually end up closing at 389.99 which puts us back under key pivot point of 390.1. This failed breakout/ recovery and closure back under that level is very bearish to me and once again sets up a run to this green channel support down at 378. The biggest thing to see here too is this is the 2nd day with a 20ema rejection and we lost the daily 8ema support again. I see far more weakness than I do strength here on SPY. 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jw12l6hc4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f0b55e1a585440590a556d1de00191bf21995915

Now the weekly much like supply and demand weekly doesn’t really provide us much details. The biggest detail I see here on the weekly is the fact that we attempted to recover the weekly 8/20ema and were immediately rejected.

This rejection is very bearish and to me sets up a lower downside. Now I also note here though that we did close under 390.1 for the 2nd week in a row. This to me with 390.1 as my key weekly pivot point (and really the key yearly pivot point) find myself looking for 375-382 before looking for a retest of 396.5. 

Now the hardest thing is that we have FOMC next week which is very likely to provide turbulence and provide unpredictability but I remain bearish going into next week and I remain much like I said back 2 weeks ago bearish on FOMC and the weeks to follow. 

SPY Weekly Levels:  
 Supply- 412.53  
 Demand- 385.9 -> 382.21 -> 357.3  
 Weekly Support- 382.4 -> 375.8  
 Weekly Resistance- 390.1 -> 396.5 

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fg6ai6zc4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=12bd67e9c8f130ccd0dd7e222dc86141999d7a54

Just as I suspected last night we are getting a 3995 supply (resistance) established on futures. That is very bearish and tells me we are right on track for a push back to 3895 support. This current supply (resistance) and demand (support) from 3995 to 3895 has actually set up a really impressive 100 point range which we have been trading within for about 8 days now. 

With this new 3995 supply (resistance) my downside target remains 3895. IF we were to lose 3895 we should look for 3833. I actually was targeting that on Wednesday but we did not quite have the strength to get there. 

The most probable daily case is that we will establish a new demand somewhere between 3833 and 3895. This would be the bounce play and that would be when I look to go long (or at least close my short). However, I still believe there is further downside to go. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t8ytt6gd4doa1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c2566e86741e5b074aa22cd681b34e83fb440f7e

From a weekly supply and demand aspect we established that 4055 supply (resistance) the last week of February. From there we bounced off 3866 demand (support) that was established back in December. 

As of right now until a new demand (support) is established we should be looking for further downside. However, I would also play slight caution here that this 3866 level has been extremely strong and we should worry about a bigger bounce off that level. On the other hand the more that this demand is beaten on the bigger chance that we drop through it.

The futures and spy daily patterns here tell me a lot of the same picture. However, as I was suspecting we actually came into a beautiful double top right off 3995. That 3995/4000 level has been a major pivot level for over a month now. With that rejection off the 200ema also and closing back under the daily 8ema and more importantly back under 3955 support (remember this was resistance for the last 4 trading days before we broke through it yesterday). 

Futures is set up perfectly for a retest of 3920 support. This is the major pivot level for futures. If they lose that level then we are heading back to that December consolidation support area which sits near 3800 to 3890. 

Now the breakout triangle here for the bear flag on futures actually shows a support at 3905 and resistance at 4005 for Monday. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yfphqjfe4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=636913276cd3394c180ce832602c119a28232dd0

Now futures weekly here actually closed out a massive doji candle here as opposed to that more hammer candle on SPY weekly. 

The biggest thing I note here is that we actually are perfectly rejecting the JPM collar calls at 4030. Why does that matter? Well the collar roll is officially in two weeks. Historically speaking over the last year I would say we are more likely to be at the collar puts (currently 3600) then we are to be at the calls… Now there was December collar roll where we were closer to the calls but that is not always the case.

My downside target here remains 3770 to 3850. Futures weekly also hard rejected the weekly 8, 20, 50 and 100ema this week. 

Futures weekly levels:  
 Supply- 4055  
 Demand- 3971 -> 3866 -> 3600  
 Weekly support- 3920 -> 3860 -> 3770  
 Weekly Resistance- 3975 -> 4020 -> 4075

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ngs21fze4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f8ffd58d7cc5307eebaec807c27cac7aa41b413

Now its actually the ugliest bull flag I have ever seen but there could very well be an opposing bull flag to the SPY bear flag. IF that is the case we are in for a massive push up on the VIX. I think the most important thing to note today about this VIX candle is the fact that it did not see the normal massive move up followed by a massive move down. 

This VIX candle shows me that hedges went on (since we opened at 22.92) early in the day and they never came back off the books. This market officially is positioning itself bearishly. I mentioned the daily 20ema support at 22 was the bounce spot and we actually did end up bouncing off 22.58 just over the daily 20ema. 

Upside target is once again the 28-29 range next week. 

**DXY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a3ydn9gf4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5abadd5a4fff86514a99224b81f7a87190169e79

I had mentioned this DXY daily breakout triangle and we are still in it. The dollar didn’t quite dump to that 103.6 level of support but is now rejecting the daily 8ema and clearly trending down.

I still am learning the dollar and honestly with stocks down and the dollar down I still am trying to find the correlation and how to benefit. My thoughts are obviously the dollar is losing value with the financial system issues and potential pause/ rate hikes next week. However, I would love some feed back on others thoughts on the dollar. 

**10YR YIELD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s4a8sewf4doa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7597ca845292af6d5b5f382165ce34b93c18c825

Of the VIX, DXY and 10YR Yield I actually find the 10yr to be most telling. If you take a look at the 10yr you can see that we are in a clear trend for the last 5 days now… huge drop in rates (because people are jumping to safety of the rates) followed by a huge rise in rates (markets going back to risk on) only to drop the next day. 

The thing I find most interesting today and the VIX did the same thing is that for the most part the 10YR did not recoil. TO me this shows that people found safety in bonds and this time they chose not to leave that safety. I think this is extremely telling of the future and whats to come. Market (or at lest big money) realizes how dire this banking situation is and I believe they are very much so positioning themselves for the worse right now. 

The most interesting thing is that we can not seem to break the 10yr lower than 3.395%. That has been a huge “support” since January 20th.

Today I actually found myself this morning in quite a bit of drawdown. I took some heavy losses turning in 4 losses (almost all full stop loss) out of my first 7 trades. I decided to take a little mental break and go for a walk. I came back and was able to put in 7 back to back wins in order to close out a green day. 

Overall profit wise not a bad week.  I was very happy with my Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday trading. However, the last two days I found myself being chopped up by everything. I just seemed to either 100% get stop loss hunted or hard bite the fake out. 

I found price action just to be very erratic and hard to trade. I also found that price action (and premiums) at times move so fast that I was left in the dust as premiums dumped 10-20 cents at a time. The other issue that happened a few times today is an extreme lack of pay out on premiums. I had two times in calls and one time in puts that for the DTE I use (which is my standard) I found that a move that was an easy 5-10% layup barely hit 1% profits. I watched a call and a put (at different times of course) move in my direction and lose value the whole time.

"Fed is at really tough spot at the moment. My initial theory was that it's going to stay flat around \~386 - (390 so far) range until rate decision. Yesterday's push and we retrace again today still sorta fits my theory.

For starter, I don't think we're going lower until tech stock letting go, bank still doing the bank stuff. The real question is now are we going up, probably hard imo. Too many unknown, and too hard to go up. The obvious thing is that everyone expecting the market to go down, but fed said, no we're not doing that...",2023-03-17
If we do go below 380 it will 100% be bought and above 405 100% be shorted. We will be stuck in this range till FOMC. 378-380 range puts us at our 3rd deviation on SPY which are rarely seen and is always a buy/sell signal. 405 is just too high without jerome speaking. 400 is probably our cap if we do pump that high.,2023-03-17
"I wouldn’t count the bulls out just yet, they have been putting quite a fight. Got nice profits today on my puts swing play and I’m actually thinking calls will be in play next Monday and Tuesday. Bulls will continue to buy the dip until we breakout out of the $396. I wouldn’t be shocked if we see $405 first.",2023-03-17
"Powell knows he fucked up and fed announced that they're ready to provide liquidity at a moment's notice. IMO, JPow wants to pause, but he knows that if he does, it will freak out the financial system that things are worse than they are. So he will probably do a .25bps as planned, exactly as the ECB did, to show that there is nothing to worry about. 


But he will likely come out the most dovish you've ever seen him. He doesn't want the market to sell-off anymore when the whole financial system is teetering at the edge of a knife. Banking stocks have plummeted, he can't afford to push more at this moment. He probably wants a relief rally now, because at this moment, financial stability (prevent a total banking meltdown) is more important than inflation. 

He doesn't want to go down in history as the guy who broke the banks. So at the FOMC, he will probably mention how they have done the most aggressive fast paced rake hikes in history, they are doing 25bps, PPI has come in soft, the CPI in jan was one-off proved by this recent print 4bps lower, unemployment is ticking up as seen through claims data, there has been stress in the financial system, and so now the lag of the hikes effects are now finally starting to showing up, and because of that, they will pause right here and go data dependent if more hikes needed.",2023-03-18
"The main thing keeping the dollar from going up right now is that people think the ECB is going to stay on a more aggressive rate path than the Fed. The dollar can absolutely benefit from the flight to safety, but we’re already at extreme levels, so interest rate expectations in Europe are enough to keep it from going up more. (Take a look at a monthly chart of DXY. Besides the past six months or so we’re sitting at a 20 year high. If there was a true lack of confidence in the dollar, we’d be a lot lower.)

The dollar is actually gaining against more economically sensitive currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars, but going down against the euro (higher rates) and yen (safety), which have heavy weightings in the DXY. 

The yen and the dollar are the two main safety currencies. Interest rates have been consistently low in Japan for years, so when treasury yields and interest rate forecasts in the US go down, the yen benefits. The opposite was true last year, which is why the yen got wrecked even though fear was up.

You can definitely look at the dollar and treasury yields to frame the narrative for stocks, but the correlations change based on the larger macro picture. It seems like we’re at a turning point where lower yields are more of a warning sign of recession instead of a green light for stocks to go higher. I think that relationship could flip back and forth for a while though, until there’s enough hard evidence to prove we’re actually going to have a recession.",2023-03-18
"Fed releases its next Rate Hike on March 22. Based on prior rate hike weeks, Spy sees extremely volatile upside going into the rate hike announcement. I easily see $400 as speculative investors flood in on the %25 chance of no bp hike.

Does that sound right? I want to understand what affect rate changes have on the market, and generally I thought higher = red, lower = green.

We continue to try and work through the rebalancing on SPY daily supply/ demand right now… We had a previous Supply at 411.04 that we did indeed come down and take out today… next target is 409.73 supply followed by 409.18 demand. If we break through those levels and close we would then start to target 406.61 demand and 405.17 supply. 

My ultimate target and where I hope to sell my 92dte puts is 399.07.

We are seeing price action signal a downside move now and we are attempting to break extreme momentum on SPY daily. 

Something I will touch more on tomorrow night is that we are also attempting (if we hold here at close tomorrow) to turn this 412.63 weekly double top into a new supply… That would mean we have taken out 409.98 weekly supply and can begin targeting 385.9 demand down below… granted I don’t think we will get that low its where our target would be until a new weekly demand comes in.

We for the first time in almost a month of trading have officially closed a daily candle below the 8ema… this is the first step in a bearish reversal… however, until momentum is fully broken and starts to push down we could still see the 20ema bounce us which should be right around that 409 price area tomorrow. 

We also have a new breakout triangle forming here at 412.2 resistance and 408 support tomorrow. 

The bears ideally want to see this close under 408 tomorrow and under the daily 20ema… IF we get that closure then I would start targeting 405.2… However if we close back over the daily 8ema tomorrow at 412 then realistically upside target would be the 414-415 area again. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 409.7 -> 405.2  
 Demand- 409.2 -> 406.6  
 Support- 409.6 -> 409.1 -> 408  
 Resistance- 412 -> 414.2

I have said a few times now I prefer watching supply and demand on the daily for futures as the price action is far more smooth then SPY… this continues to be the case and I continue to see 4178 supply as a key resistance. With a closure under the daily 8ema we should once again start to target 4116 demand. IF we break through that level we have a pretty steep descent to 4040/4055. 

Weekly wise we are attempting to establish a new 4173 supply which takes out current weekly 4149 supply and makes our downside target at 4055 supply.

We once again broke pretty much the last support I see from this bull run up today. With this support being broken we will now look for the daily 8ema to turn into resistance and we will watch this new black resistance line. 

Target should remain the daily 20ema which will hover right around 4120 tomorrow.

I saw someone compare the VIX in 2008 to current VIX and thought I would look for myself… now past does not predict the future BUT if we analyze these two charts there is a case to be made that the previous peak on the VIX we hard in March is the peak of July 2008… and that the September VIX bottom is our current bottom… IF that is the case then the major leg down is about to start…

VIX broke through resistance today and closed a nice doji… however, failed to close over the daily 8ema once again. We will watch that key 17.1 level and 17.74 level tomorrow… a closure over the 8ema to end the week could bring a bearish move next week…

I had a pretty decent day trading today.. as you can see mid day today I got really chopped up… I had saw the reversal conditions forming on the 5 and 15min chart around 1pm and I was attempting to get in on it. Of course I got stop loss hunted 2 times in a row and took some small profits on the way down… I missed out on that whole leg down as I kept waiting for a good reentry that didn’t feel like chasing. 

I was very salty getting stopped out and then it immediately rejected back to a profitable spot. But that’s the name of the game. We cant always and wont always get every move and our timing as much as we try to be perfect will never be perfect every single time…. But in the end we put in a really nice profitable day again today… 

As of right now (if I didn’t trade tomorrow) This is my most profitable trading week since the first week of March. I am looking forward to ending tomorrow on another good note as this has been a great week of trading.",2023-04-20

"Well a lot of people like to think that the market doesn’t care about rate hikes and that the market has stopped caring about what JPOW has to say… today would prove that is absolutely incorrect…

Now this wasn’t quite Jackson hole 2.0 this was just as exciting. Overall the most interesting thing to me is that I didn’t see anywhere that JPOW said we were going to pause in June at FOMC… However, the Market actually went from a 64.4% odds of a pause at open to now an 81.5% odds we pause at the June FOMC.

Looking at next week really we do have some data to keep in mind and of course more fed speakers… most notable is that there is nothing on Monday. PMI Tuesday, Wednesday FOMC minutes will be the big one to keep an eye on… I actually have a strong suspicion that we will run Monday Tuesday then make Wednesday our top…. Prelim GDP Thursday and then Friday is PCE, personal income and then lastly UMICH inflation. 

Not amazing data that I think sends us 1% +/- pre market but definitely stuff to keep an eye on. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

I have great news for you guys! I spent a very long time doing some back testing (unfortunately its all manual). While I am no longer granted access to the other supply and demand indicator I have found high success and correlation with this new indicator I am using. I will not be sharing exactly how I derive these levels but they are very promising and I have been using it the last two days intraday day trading and I have had some amazing success. 

I look forward to these levels on a daily and weekly timeframe now and hope you guys enjoy them too. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t1pwwlxnpu0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=db520b76907a562809728cdb743c592535ae861e

From a supply and demand stand point here after we put in 410.2 demand (support) we have not looked back at all… we have flown through a ton of supplies from 413.05 to 419.5… 419.5 was a major level that I was keeping an eye on and is a major pivot point. Now we did break over it and reject. However, note that this daily candle is NOT a double top. 

Also note that after 419.5 there is no resistance or levels until 429.68. 

The way I am reading this is that our target really should be 429.68. However, a few things we need to note… the weekly on SPY is about to enter extreme bull momentum. The DMI is almost extreme overbought also. There are a few other things I am watching too and most of those besides one is bullish. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/br8eydeopu0b1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8d6dcc91d078f1037b66e1a6c910f253edc5afa4

Now when I look at the weekly I think its very important to note that not only did we close over 416.08 weekly supply (resistance) but we also established a new demand (support) at 411.46 this week. We essentially retested and bounced off the now support of the range for the last almost 2 months and now we are on a push up.

The next major upside target is 427.35 supply from August. After that I don’t have much until 453.23 (now I don’t expect that to happen just noting). 

From a technical standpoint with us putting in a fresh demand (support) we should continue to expect upside until a new weekly supply (resistance) is put in. We also had a very nice bounce off the weekly 8ema. Now the difference from daily to weekly is that the DMI is not overbought at all and actually is in the process of waving up which means this bullishness on a weekly timeframe has a good amount left to go…

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

https://preview.redd.it/axrcn72ppu0b1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7f5ae442d12ac6dfb5b75c81df51d38a2e648cf7

We remain in the black rising wedge on the daily and also have a smaller timeframe rising red wedge too. Now we were not able to close over 419.5 which in my opinion is a major pivot point. However this candle is not a true rejection and downside candle in my opinion either. 

The most probable case is either a drop back to 416 to 416.8 to retest support and the daily 8ema before we push higher or there is a case where we see a pretty strong Monday and Tuesday run and then the markets negatively react to FOMC minutes and that becomes our temporary top. 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tk5w6ijppu0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=128eaf1fff3e61a2f1d384fd6f830b92528a5139

Now as I mentioned 427.35 was a weekly supply and target I had. IF you look at the weekly PA here we have a major resistance and pivot point there also from the August top. This in my opinion is 100% the next major resistance and the next major bull target to watch. 

Now that the bulls have officially broken out of this range we had been in for almost 2 weeks and have a nice weekly 8ema support bounce I will be looking for that continued upside. 

I honestly get told I am a permabear a lot.. but I really do play both sides… its just that from a macro/ economic/ just reality stand point we in no way shape or form should be looking at the 430s… honestly from a value standpoint I would say that 390s would be a fair price target right now. 

SPY Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 416.1 -> 427.4  
 Demand- 411.5   
 Support- 412.1 -> 407.7 -> 404  
 Resistance- 418.6 -> 422 -> 427.6

On futures daily S/D is the same story here… however, the difference is that we did put in that 4127 demand (support) and pushed through quite a few supplies…

We did leave 4040-4055 supplies down low and now have a bigger sell off magnet to 4150-4154 also. However, the futures daily is a double top right now. The thing I am watching for to happen is that we immediately turn around and go from double top to double bottom off 4200. In doing so we should start to seek out upside still.

There is a chance that we could sell off Monday to establish 4216 as a new supply (resistance). In doing so we would take out 4190/4197 supplies. We would target a bounce off the daily 8ema near 4170-4180 for a support bounce. That would most probably establish a new demand which would give us the technical support to continue to push higher.

From the weekly here we did much like SPY establish a new weekly demand (support) at 4130 which is the bottom of our range that we have been in for the last 8 weeks now. Not only that but we are also going to completely bullishly engulf this last 2 months of trading with this closure over the 4193 supply. 

Right now my weekly target on Futes would be 4284.

From a price action stand point I mentioned that I would be curious if the daily could come back down to retest 4191 or not… We have officially at this point turned previous major resistance into now support. I would like to see one more closure over it and potentially even another bounce off it to feel 100% confident that it is support but this chart looks very bullish for me. 

One note is that we still have not gotten through that 4240 resistance area from February highs. 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jhli4scrpu0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=086091f660a5ada8ead6131462edd1cb94094490

The first thing to talk about is that this was officially the 7th week post JPM collar roll… I have mentioned a few times that there is a historical trend of reversing the direction of the 7 weeks post leading into week 11. However, there is a few times where we have seen the trend actually explode even more. 

It is possible that we could see another 4 weeks of running before we find a top… one other thing to mention is that the JPM collar calls are at 4300 and we have often touched that level before rejecting. 

This weekly double bottom/ bullish engulfing candle in my opinion is very bullish and very strong for the bulls next week. However, we are now coming into some pretty strong resistance dating back to August. 4280 is the PA top from August which is right near that 4284 supply that I am targeting also. 

Futures Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 4293 -> 4284  
 Demand- 4130 -> 3920  
 Support- 4130 -> 4095  
 Resistance- 4200 -> 4223 -> 4280

**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

It has been long requested that I include QQQ and I don’t usually like to include anything more then I am already looking at but I do wanna start keeping a closer eye on Tech. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1jantgsrpu0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=436f6ca47c29cc19a360fca12f9de9fb332150fb

Now the QQQ daily is due for a pullback and I actually full expect to see that Monday. We today established a new supply at 337.29 and at the same time to the penny rejected my the demand level that has been level on the charts since March of 2022. So now that this demand level is finally taken out the question is what is next? 

From an S/D stand point once a new supply is established we look for a retrace to previous supply or the EMA (especially since we are in extreme bull momentum). For QQQ I see a pullback to 333.11 and if it wants to hold this yellow rising wedge it can drop no lower than 332 on Tuesday. 

The daily 8ema is likely going to become a hard bounce and establish a new demand and even possible turn 333 supply into a demand. In doing so my upside target would be 347.11 supply and potentially on a huge blow off top 351.57 demand. 

**QQQ WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/13gz1v9spu0b1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e69a4707f2664e96e54fe9772a5975ea4a1688d

I find myself on QQQ weekly S/D feeling the same way I do about SPY weekly that a bigger upside move is coming. This week QQQ actually established a new demand (Support) at 322.47. In doing so it pushed hard through 330.67 supply. We now have about a $31 lull in levels where this is no clear resistance. 

However from a weekly stand point DMI is still waving up (bullish) and we are still in extreme bull momentum with some other technical also supporting a bigger move up or atleast bullishness.

I would NOT be short QQQ until we see a new supply put in and even then I would only be short till we see the weekly 8ema. 

**VIX**

Looking at the F/G index you can see we are nearing the same level of FG that we did almost a month ago when we were actually lower then current levels. IT would appear that the FG wants to push back into extreme greed. AT that time is when I would start to consider 60-90dte puts. My guess is that will be around the time FOMC happens. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/elwj4psspu0b1.png?width=847&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c07f8200491672749cf5fcd48ec8f66b56acc618

Now one interesting thing about the VIX which also supports the bullishness on SPY/QQQ is the fact that we are in weekly extreme bear momentum on VIX. This means the downside should continue to be expected. 

We did come down however and have a really nice inside candle body on VIX. We also attempted to get back over that critical 16.92 VIX level, however, we hard rejected the daily 8/20ema and closed in the 16s again. 

I actually in all honestly would not be surprised to see the VIXs in the 14s in the next week or two. 

**DXY/ 10YR YIELD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2e7ryqdtpu0b1.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4968299fa044a9ccf24e3a5660e5f635a01f9b34

Now one thing I said I was very confused on is the fact that DXY and the 10YR rallied with SPY/QQQ. We should have seen the opposite affect. DXY did break its support line from this breakout…. A bigger sell off in the DXY back to the 101-102 area could be the final push up on spy/ tech. I am also seeing the 10YR come into decent resistance here and would be surprised to see some weakness start to show up in the 10YR. 

**WEEKLY TRADING LOG**

I had a great day and an even better week trading. I actually during that JPOW speech hit a nice 50% gainer which I honestly cant remember the last time ive had a win that big. I unfortunately missed on my first put about 100% gainer but in the end profits are profits and you never know how those events are gonna go.

I actually put in again my most profitable week of 2023 and my most profitable week since December of 2022. 

From a day trading stand point (as in not including swings or lottos) this is my most profitable week of strictly day trading since October 2022. 

I continue to find my confidence but also most importantly my patience in this market. I had a really big problem before of either not trusting myself or chasing plays too much. I have found myself now that I am okay missing a play as I know there will always be another play. I have also never felt so confident and trusting in my strategy that has proven itself to be worthy of the trust. 

I look forward to another great week of trading next week!",2023-05-19
"My guy, did you not watch the presser with JPOW and the 20 articles right after that used this quote: ""As a result our policy rate may not need to rise as much as it would have otherwise to achieve our goals"" and the fact that the odds of a pause in June immediately jumped to over 80% right after he said that?? The market should have flown today but it was red instead bc of the very reason I mentioned in your thread yesterday, the debt ceiling. Once news broke of stalled talks, the market sank. Watch out for some big red early next week if no agreement reached over the weekend and also if an agreement is reached.

Just wondering - yesterday you mentioned if we close under 419.51 today then you’d likely target 412-410 next week. You seem more bullish today even though we closed under 419.51. What made you change your opinion? Thanks for the great analysis as always!,2023-05-19

"> Overall the most interesting thing to me is that I didn’t see anywhere that JPOW said we were going to pause in June at FOMC… However, the Market actually went from a 64.4% odds of a pause at open to now an 81.5% odds we pause at the June FOMC.

WSJ Interview 2.0… 2-7-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,2023-02-07
"Looking at this article from Bespoke you can see that incredibly of the last 13 trading days only one of those closed below its open… that means despite how red we opened or how green we opened we closed above our open. IT just shows the incredible strength and memeness of this rally. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cp0lndi4uuga1.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=563e5ed1655a594812eb1aa41917ec025f718279

I thought I had seen it all and then we have SPY who managed to pump nearly $7… drop $8 and then proceed to repump nearly $9 all within a 4 hour time period. This was the most wild amount of swinging I have seen in a very long time. This was like a FOMC meeting mixed with CPI on steroids. 

So the question remains… who is in control? Where are we headed next? Unfortunately the answer is not simple and there truthfully is a case for >420 and there is a case for <405. Lets break it down…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1n6xndz4uuga1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=85cd82e85afce6ca8825b04ff57aa19305878d52

Bull case- despite breaking support of the 7 week long bull channel at open we held the daily 8ema and once again as highlighted by the three black arrows bounced off that support and pushed higher. We broke the breakout triangle resistance that was established last week and managed to bullishly engulf yesterdays price action. Despite JPOW re-iterating his hawkishness for the rest of the year we did not see markets digest it even remotely as such. Markets are clearly running rampant and it appears that it is going to take a shock to end this momentum we have currently. Despite the daily bull channel support being broken we did maintain the weekly bull channel support. 

Bear case- We broke through a 7 week long bull channel support. Despite the EOD pump there was a sliver of hope when we say that $8 dump after jpow stopped talking today. Now we did breakout again to the upside, however, we hard rejected and failed to continue that break out over the key 416.8 resistance area. This is where the TA has to be weighed on what is most significant. While we clearly saw SPY break through the bull channel support and breaking a 7 week long multiple point support line is a very big deal we do have to factor in the algos. Now the fact that we saw algos dump this $8 could lead to some downside to come. The first and most major resistance line comes next at 419.5 if this rally was to continue. 

If you support the bull case and believe that the bounce off of 408.8 support/ daily 8ema is bullish and that markets will not digest any bearish news right now then we should be looking for a push to 419.5 and eventually 427.5. There is a case to be made for a rally into CPI. CPI very well could cause a final blow off top to the 430-450 area IF it is good. OR it very well could be the top and start a very long retracement back to that 390-400 area. 

IF you support the bear case and believe that a 7 week long bull channel breaking is highly significant and will significantly outweigh the bull case and shows a clear break in the momentum then we should first look for a retest of that 409 key support area and from there is we lose 405.3 it is back to 390-400 area. There is an equal weighted case to be made that markets with CPI in exactly one week from today will start to go risk off and will fear a miss (hotter than expected) CPI and that could start a very strong leg down on the market. 

Whats the best case here? Honestly im very indifferent. There was a sliver of hope and sensibility in this market today when we saw the retrace back to 409. However, the fact that JPOW re-iterated his hawkishness (yes I know he said disinflation and I will say this till im blue that word does NOT mean what most people thinks it means and honestly JPOW himself misquoted what disinflation was today when he said that he would stick by his word of disinflation that there is a drop in inflation) and despite all that the markets still rallied almost $9 says a lot. The algos are clearly locked in on this bull run and its really hard to see an end game on that right now. 

My personal thoughts are that when we look at the WSJ interview back in November and previous FOMCs that they usually signal a local top. With CPI next week and the fact that we already pulled back and broke through the 7 week long bull channel support I do suspect we could see a pullback to test 405.3 support area. IF we break through that then I like 390-400 to be retested. However, if we continue this rally I would bet on 419.5 being the highest probability of a top a good CPI could see a blow off top much like Decembers to touch 427.5 area but the further we get from 409 the less I believe this rally will continue. 

Historically speaking days like this and FOMC have generally caused massive intraday rallies and then have given it all up immediately afterwards the next day. There is a pretty strong base case and we are seeing it on a small scale right now that we pullback to that 409 to 411 support area tomorrow. 

Key SPY Support- 412.5 -> 411.5 -> 408.8 -> 406.5 -> 405.3

Key SPY Resistance- 415.2 -> 416.9 -> 419.5

&#x200B;

The one thing I love about trading SPY but also watching futures closely is that they can at times paint a slightly different story. Sometimes SPY can give us hints of whats to come and sometimes futures can do that same too and at other times they can give extra confirmation. 

One thing that is very important to note here is that despite SPY breaking its 7 week long bull channel futus did NOT break its… However, what we have here is a break through of that red resistance line for the breakout triangle however we found ourselves hard rejecting right at the possible double top off 4177. If we were to see futes overnight and into tomorrow hold 4177 as resistance we could be looking to come back down and retest that key 4123 to 4145 support area. 

There is a true 4123 double bottom on futures though off that daily 8ema much like we see over on spy and have seen the last two times we attempted to breakdown. 

Futures will be very interesting to watch overnight and into tomorrow. 

Key Futures Support- 4145 -> 4123 -> 4095 -> 4085

Key Futures Resistance- 4177 -> 4210 -> 4235

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xbp3f066uuga1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=acf5ecbe20dcf10a6caa5b807fc2c5d4ef86cf45

And then there was tesla… what can I say about ole girl… So I mentioned on SPY that we broke through that 7 week long bull channel support line and that we had to weigh the overall strength and significance of that against the overall strength of this rally… Well we are seeing here on Tesla that we also have a major support line broken. Not only that we also have closed on the daily a potential reversal hanging man candle resistance perfectly at 197.1. Remember I have been saying this 197.1 level is a MAJOR resistance on tesla and not only that… this is now the 4th day in a row (the other 3 also closed in dojis or reversal down candles) that we have seen Tesla attempt to break through 197.1 resistance and fallen short. 

By all means from a LOGICAL (and remember I say logical and REALLY emphasize that) standpoint… four rejections at probably one of the biggest resistance levels for Tesla, a hanging man reversal (bearish) candle closure on the daily AND breaking a major 5 week long rising wedge support line SHOULD 100% without a doubt lead to a retrace. 

Now with that being said… its obvious that this market is anything buy logical and despite how logical a fairly large retrace on Tesla would be for tomorrow… this could very well continue green. 

Tesla officially closed its 6th green day in a row and has now closed green 12 out of the last 13 trading days. This is a pretty incredible run here. If we get a bigger retrace tomorrow 184 is another major support area I would watch for a bounce at. 

Key Tesla Support- 190.2 -> 184 -> 181.5  
 Key Tesla Resistance- 197.1 -> 200.9 -> 204.8 -> 208.7

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59ip3be7uuga1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3b70632c950fca8dd7d3615eff147f3413409033

Now to add to the base case confusion on what comes next lets take the VIX. Today we saw (prior to JPOW) the VIX berak through key 19.9 resistance. Effectively when it did that as you can see if broke through a trend line that dates back to the middle of October. What happened in the middle of October? Oh that’s right.. Spy put in its 52 week low (and potentially its bear market bottom). 

So we have a 4 month long resistance line that was officially breached today and should 100% open up the upside for the VIX to see a return to trading back in the 20-23 range. However, as you can see as soon as we broke through that level we immediately rejected 19.99 and actually ended up closing back below the daily 8ema. WE now find the VIX trading back near that crucial support range of 18.3. 

**Daily log-**

I used to find myself enjoying playing days like today where the volatility is stupid high and you can make 50% in 10 seconds when the candle pumps $2 out of no where. However, after getting burnt on so many days like this I decided it was best to sit it out plus we held such a tight high IV range this morning it was not worth playing. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ihykult7uuga1.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=058d7539e205f6c06c30b43126265458237cc4a1

When we hard rejected my 414.3 volatility level and lose 413.58 volatility level after that pump I decided it was time to short JPOW… I am happy I did. Not too often you get to score a 25.4% win on a 31dte within 22minutes of opening it. I was planning to keep this till we retested 405/406 area. However as I ALWAYS say… secure profits and mitigate losses! Ever 5% above 20% I hit I set a stop limit sell and eventually was tagged at 25%. And by golly am I glad I have decent risk management skills because if I had held this I would be down about 12%... which honestly in all reality is NOT that bad and I had planned even if we kept pumping to average down every +$5 that would be a nearly 37% swing in P/L had i held instead of closing. 

The lesson today is this… 1. We do NOT have to trade everyday. And 2. No matter how much we believe in a move or how much we believe our play will continue to gain profits…. NEVER forget to secure profits.",2023-02-07

imo seeing TSLA struggle so much to keep up with SPY today really showed me we very much could be seeing that short term top. picked up a TSLA put eod good luck everyone.,2023-02-08
"Had a great day, played a 408/412 strangle and managed to sell the calls at the initial top securing profit and closed the puts on the way down. Could’ve made even more if I had waited another 10 minutes to sell the puts when we hit 408 but can’t complain about a 45% profit play. 

Eyeing TSLA puts tomorrow depending on how we look strength wise. If we stall out in this 415-417 area on SPY will look to open a 9-16DTE TSLA put position since I feel the only thing keeping TSLA from drilling again is that SPY is showing this insane regard strength and keeping the market afloat through bearish after bearish news",2023-02-08

I sold my 0dte spy puts too early today and I need to tell someone,2023-03-10
"Hi, I'd like to apply to be the head dummy around these parts...For context I swung spy calls overnight (like a buffoon but it worked out) and sold them at open at the high. I felt like a king. Immediately following after, I dumped my winnings into spy puts because why stop gambling at 10 am when the market closes at 430? So I did just that. Dumped around 600 bucks into 398 poots (I know I'm not super baller like some of these idiots in this sub)

I had a rule though.... I told myself that once I hit a certain profit, I will sell half and then at another level sell the other half. I **know** 0dte contracts on spy wither away as fast as you can say ""my wife's boyfriend"". Spy dropped quick enough for me to see some profits and gaze at my phone while my boss asked when is this big project done. He could kick rocks for all I cared. I made his monthly pay in 20 minutes on my phone. Eventually spy dropped more for me to sell all my puts. I felt great I liked the price I sold at. Spy hit a reversal heading back up and I felt like I played the Wall St. Cucks in NYC. 

After showboating for a mere 10 minutes, Spy dropped......and dropped....and kept....on.....dropping. I was shocked. I was terrified to look at what my 398 puts were at. I sold at $1.00 a contract (100 dollars each for the idiots). And these contracts hit $7.00 each. I wanted to cry just thinking about it. With tears in my eyes I pulled out my calculator and did the math. It was disgusting what I missed out on. My measly $2400 cash in my Robinhood didn't compare to the $11,000 (or so) missed profit. 

I felt like I just got punished for listening to myself and following my rules. Why couldn't I have just let them *rideeee* out. 

Anyway I was so furious the entire day and just had to write this out. I may just take the remaining money and spend it on something that won't stab me in the ^(fukin) heart like these puts did to my soul. Just kidding, I dumped half my equity into Aapl calls for tomorrow. I literally cannot wait for them to expire worthless so I can quit trading. Thank you for reading my tedtalk, please feel free to tear me apart.

edit: thank you for all the kind words and the “don’t feel bad”. I still feel like garbage. BUT, I know i know , the would’ve should’ve could’ve will always eat you up if you keep thinking about it . all jokes aside, it’s only a bad thing if you don’t learn from it.",2023-03-10

You didn't lose today! 

If we get hung up on what could have been, we'll hold future trades too long and let them turn red.

"I looked at your strategy for alternating calls and puts and its vaguely what I had ascertained as an optimal strategy (trust me bro). I had wanted to get into options last month but hadn’t pulled the trigger until now buts good to see I may be on the right track. Only difference I can see is I havent gotten around to buying leaps yet, only monthlies. I prefer strangles but that leaves you to losing in a non volatile market. I just like the V pattern ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271).

However my overall market thesis is pretty imminently  bearish considering inflation, QE, the market narrative being that a recession can be avoided when that is obviously not the case, margin debt, chinese commercial paper failing with the chinese real estate market along with the pending housing crisis that is seeming to loom globally, Russia defaulting on foriegn bonds (relatively minor), fear and green index indicators etc. and has been for about 6 months. Unfortunately it seems the market makers love kicking the can and seem to love max pain non volatility after periods of volatilty to fuck my plays /s based on the assumption the correction will come on quickly and last longer than a year. Now ive revised my thesis to believing that it is in their interest to drag out bear markets to about a year of recession to unwind positions and so history will repeat itself as I should have known.

Im not sure what will be the final straw but the last few months feel like the market finally acknowledging the family of elephants in the room. My guess is the music is gonna stop and one of the bigger boys will be caught with no clothes and thatll be the Bear Sterns of our generation.

Id love to hear other opinions on whether or when the market will correct. But if you dont acknowledge inflation youre gonna get a boop.",2022-06-28

The Road to 405 SPY/ 4095 ES… 3-29-23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Daily Market Analysis,2023-03-29
"As I have been saying since pretty much Friday we have been left with some very low volume and incredibly tight intraday ranges. As you can see below this is our longest streak of less than 1% moves in over a year. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uc3oxrmrnqqa1.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e5170b749c79bd7e551c699141fa31c9319efd1d

Watching price action again we are left with significant overnight ranges and from open till about power hour we consolidate in a tight range before we finally break out. I for one can not really remember a time when we have had <$2 intraday range from 930a to 3pm and then had that range nearly doubled during power hour. Its very interesting watching these tight ranges. 

It almost feels like there is not enough actual intraday buying going on then EOD all the calls/ puts OI is coming off the books and causing a huge move. Actually one of the most impressive things about today is that for most of the day our S&p500 breadth was 20:1+ which is actually a very strong buy pressure…. Despite that we actually showed a ton of intraday weakness until the EOD when we finally had a rally basically from 230 till EOD. 

Tech as a whole today had a very generously green day with Amazon putting in a huge 3.1% green day. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5mkqj74snqqa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=887edaf792e11acb66cef3618c05481a31da852e

We as far as I was concerned had no true direction yesterday but with the reversal doji on spy I did favor upside potential. However, today markets chose the bullish side of things.

One of the strongest things that can happen is when a supply is turned into demand or demand is turend into supply. Today we actually have the bulls turning that 395.8 supply into a demand at 395.56 (support). With this we are now on the move to put in a new supply. With this new demand (support) it also opens up the potential to test previous supplies.

Since we gapped over and tested 399.07 supply and turned that into support our upside target should be 405.17 supply (resistance) here. 

I see really two scenarios here… first is we push to 405.2 and reconfirm that as supply or put in a slightly higher suppy closer to 407 before we see a bigger retrace to take our 405.2 and 399.07 supply. The second scenario is that we see a pretty big red day tomorrow to establish a new supply (resistance) at 401.3. IF we do that then we should come down to take out 399.07 supply and I would target a retest of 395.56 and 393.07 demands. We either reconfirm one of those as demand (support) or attempt to establish a new demand somewhere near 390. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kf8xedksnqqa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=15c8f2eb8deef8d690c386287bde7f9bc0020e76

Bulls from a price action stand point actually put in a pretty strong day today. We finally broke out of the 391.8 to 399 consolidation channel and actually turned 399 into support as of now. We also finally saw a turn breakout of the breakout/down triangle. 

From a bullish stand point with a breakout of consolidation, the breakout triangle, a closure over the daily 200 ema and a 8/20ema bullish crossover are target here should remain 405.2. Since we reconfirmed 390 as support for this purple channel our next logical expectation is 405.2 resistance retest. 

On a bearish stand point we have a potential abandoned baby pattern formed here… not this is a very rarely played out pattern but it’s a fun one to watch… for this to play out we need a pretty good sized red pre market/ open. 

Realistically from a price action and supply/ demand stand point here I see a path to retest 405.2 tomorrow and then knowning the historics of the JPM collar day I would not be surprised to see us put in a pretty good sized red day Friday with a red open too (will cover that more tomorrow night). This is our fourth day in a row of very tight $3-4 range days… we are overdue for a big trend day. 

SPY Daily Levels:  
 Supply- 399.1 -> 405.2  
 Demand- 395.6 -> 393.1  
 Support- 399.8 -> 399 -> 395.5  
 Reistance- 401.5 -> 404.5 -> 405.2

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2hlil14tnqqa1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e62b34aed84d88707acd58a78d55d2ff8c4db5ed

On futures here we did not turn supply into demand but we did establish a new demand (support) at 4005. 

With that and now the potential to close over key 4055 supply (resistance) our target here on futures should be to push to 4095 and take out that demand. If and when we take out that demand we actually have a potential to turn that into supply (resistance)… that would open up a potential for a retrace all the way back to 4015 to take out those supplies. This tends to be the trajectory that I believe we are working under… I do forsee a potential where we could put in a new supply (resistance) before we get to 4095 though. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ih00adjtnqqa1.png?width=789&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eaf3638188912c58d11094aff43582e7e703003b

Much like here on SPY we broke through the breakout triangle and today we once again confirmed the daily 8ema as support. We are actually about to see a daily 8ema crossover the daily 200ema also. 

With this closure over 4055 we should look for a push to the next major resistance area which is 4085 to 4095. 

If we close over 4095 there is realistically a case where we could breakout back to 4160 area but more probably we will reject at or near 4095 and come back down to test the daily 200ema near 4000. 

Much like SPY my base case here is an upside push to 4095 followed by a retrace back to 4015. 

Futures Daily Levels:  
 Supply- 4015 -> 4040 -> 4055 -> 4160  
 Demand- 4095 -> 4005  
 Support- 4055 -> 4040 -> 4015 -> 4000  
 Resistance- 4065 -> 4085 -> 4095

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4suktqytnqqa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0222a0c80dcd93f649cbc76cc24488e791acb99e

The VIX had another good sized drop today but one thing to note is that the VIX did leave a pretty good sized gap from 19.91 to 19.45… The VIX of all the tickers ive ever watched is one that does not like to leave a gap unfilled for too long. 

I am seeing this set up pretty perfectly for a big drop on the VIX tomorrow to 18.2 with SPY hitting 405.2 and futures hitting that 4095 area… Followed by a very red open Friday and potentially red day Friday too.

Today ended up being a good day… I got a second chance to close out my 396calls I have been holding (was busy Monday and missed my 399 closure at open). I got greedy on both my 5dte plays and didn’t take 3-4% gains on both expecting some sort of continuation only to get completely chopped up. These tight range days are very tough to trade as everything looks beautiful for contiuation and then you are left with a reversal. Not only that but when the total intraday range 3 hours in is barely $1.5 premiums just don’t pay enough. 

I ended up switching to some scalping today and had some very high success with that to recover some profits. I do plan when we see these tight range days plan to drop my dte and play some quick hit scalps. I actually forgot how fun it was to scalp as I havent done true scalps since about december. I don’t forsee myself going back to 0dte anytime soon as premiums still are funky enough to not warrant it but I did enjoy some of these lower dte scalps.

Well we have now broken under the two day mark leading into FOMC… as of now it is pretty much fully expected that we will get a 25bps hike…

However, that really doesn’t matter at all… what matters? What matters is what JPOW has to say… Will he hint at a pause next meeting (June 14th), will be confirm rate hikes by EOY, what does he have to say about the banking crisis and FRC? There is a lot of things that we are going to get some clarity on…

What else matters? How the market reacts… IF they finally actually listen to what JPOW has to say…

No real movement here from a supply and demand stand point.. However, a red day tomorrow almost certainly will turn 415.55 into a new supply (resistance) which will allow us to target 412.62 and eventually 404.3 again. 

We did again attempt a break through of 417.03 supply, however, that became a major resistance.

This is a fairly textbook bearish reversal set up… I actually was EXTREMLY tempted to swing puts overnight but im not sure if I will make opening hour or not. 

However, what we have here is a massive blue rising wedge with our extremely tight 4 day long red bull channel. Not only that but we put in a really nice evening doji star reversal pattern… in doing sowe should almost certainly target 411.44 to 412.6 for tomorrow. 

415.29 is the red support line for the bull channel tomorrow… which means bulls have to open green and hold green all day in order to hold that. 

I still will be looking for a downside move tomorrow. Tomorrow is pre-FOMC so we should expect some more ranging but also could see some risk off into the meeting.

 Supply- 412.6 -> 415.3 -> 417  
 Demand- 404.3  
 Support- 412.6 -> 411.4 -> 409.2  
 Resistance- 416 -> 416.9 -> 419.6

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

The bulls once again attempted to breach 4198 supply on futures and found themselves with a very strong rejection much like back on 4/18.

We did not establish any new supply or demand levels but much like SPY a red day tomorrow should turn 4190 into a new supply (resistance) which allows us to come down and take out 4178 -> 4158 and eventually retest 4085. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

I actually believe that futures daily is far more bearish looking than SPY. You can see the large blue rising wedge we are trading within… you can also see the really nice 4190 double top and rejection off 4200. 

With this daily double top and evening doji star reversal pattern… there is downside to be expected tomorrow. 

I would target 4178 as a major support area to watch and then we can start looking at that key 4150-4158 support area. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4158 -> 4178 -> 4198  
 Demand- 4085  
 Support- 4178 -> 4150 -> 4110  
 Resistance- 4190 -> 4225

**VIX, DXY and 10YR YIELD**

Now I generally prefer to show these all on tradingview but I wanted to show you the three daily charts all right next to eachother and compared right next to SPY…

Now these are all the daily time frame and what I want to point out here is the huge rising wedge on SPY with a downside potential target of 395-400… this rising wedge perfectly aligns with the VIXs current falling wedge with upside target of 20-25, DXY falling wedge (which it just broke out of) with upside target of 103-104, and the 10YR yield that also just broke out today with an upside target of 3.75-3.85%.

If we are seeing the strength return to the dollar finally and 10Yr yield then we could be in store for some more SPY downside. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4eruyadm6axa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a3044d0242ff7a3d961844a68392ba93e9091e28

The VIX  itself is in two separate falling wedges… a short term falling wedge which goes with the short term bull channel on SPY/ futures… expecting outside of a pretty heavily red gap down on VIX that VIX breaks through its 15.76 resistance for tomorrow we should see a push back to the 17-18 range on the VIX. 

The VIX amazingly put in yet another 52 week low today touching 15.53. 

I would be fairly surprised to see the VIX not have at least a little rise going into FOMC… especially sitting at 52 week low and the lowest level going into FOMC in well over 1.5 years…

Today ended up being a great day… I actually struggled early morning during power hour. I was on the wrong end of that 10am dump and then was on the wrong end of the recovery. Honestly I think for the next week or so I am going to start sitting out opening hour like I used to as the last 1-2 weeks my opening hour trades have not been that great. 

After that honestly had a great day and honestly as a technical based trader the setups were really good. I did get stop loss hunted one time mid day but other than that everything played out pretty well today… much better trading than Thursday and Friday. 

I was able to secure almost my full weeks profit today… 

Today was a heavy lesson and good reminder of using proper risk management and when you have a successful strategy that in the end you have to trust it… I got stopped out 3 plays in a row and took pretty decent loss to start the day… but I didn’t get frustrated and revenge trade… I stuck to my strategy and my take profit targets and in the end had an amazing day.",2023-05-01

Let me explain… going into this week I was fairly confident in a hot CPI which would have bene the bearish catalyst for no rate cuts, no pause and another 25bps rate hike in a month at FOMC… however, that did not obviously happen with that “cooler” CPI print we now find ourselves just barely scraping by from a market sell off… however, as this EOW price action would suggest we don’t quite have the upside pressure bulls should have hear to take this higher. 

We truly are in an extremely painful spot in this market… theta and IV crush is hitting like no other… there is no trend and there is absolutely no continuation. We are so far in my opinion overbought that I find it highly unwise to go long (plus I truly believe this market is literally scraping by on fumes and one of these days is going to let go) however, we clearly are being held up by big tech that its very unwise to go short… so what are we left to do here? Well first off ALWAYS remember CASH IS A POSITION! But honestly this is a day traders dream as we have some pretty solid movement that is really setting up for some nice intraday plays. 

I truly looking at the technicals (Which I will cover below) believe we are about as close to the top of this trend as we are going to get… however, we haven’t gotten the signals and flashing red lights that its time to go short… for now its time to play the range and wait for us to pick a direction… 

**BONUS TESLA TA**

On tesla Daily here we got a lot going on.. so I was VERY much so bullish EOD yesterday and was looking for the pump… the tesla ceo news caused the pump to the 173.98 targets I was looking for. Now this is where you gotta remember “buy the rumor sell the news.” What actually happened is that this huge pump put in a huge high volatility bearish day…

This is what we have right now is a bearish engulfing daily candle (4 day long actually), a failed breakout of this downward channel, and a closure back under that 168.57 demand which is the daily 8ema… this was a massive failed breakout and with this rejection a new supply at 172.27 was put in… that means our target is now the 160.87 supply. We also have bearish daily IV and with bearish price action. We also loss the red support line which was a 3 point touch… 

My ultimate target for next week is 160.87 (-4.3%) with an extreme target of 153.8 (-8.9%). 

I took a half sized 167.5P 7dte put play for this… looking to hold till at least 160.87.

Well until the EOD pump (a classic for SPY) I was actually thinking we might finally see SPY rebalance itself by closing under that 411.15 supply. However, we actually closed back over that supply so as of right now we still would be considered imbalanced. So this still either needs to close under 411.15 OR attempt to turn 411.15 into demand (support). As of right now we are in the process of discovering our next demand (support). However, I do not have a true target for that yet. 

It is extremely difficult (on spy at least) to find where this wants to end up… Our biggest support targets are 404.3 to 405.06 and resistance is 415.56 to 417.03. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iyjwb80ktgza1.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0b8b6e1a0ac27a30fe6d7a1fea2a08f4a4f05305

The weekly supply/ demand chart actually is the one thing right now that makes me VERY bearish… one of the indicators I use (I do apologize I can not share it nor can I discuss the interworkings of it) has officially finally signaled a BEARISH weekly reversal… what does this mean? It means that we finally have reached a place where the technicals are supporting further downside. 

Spy weekly did close below that 411.87 demand (support) that does open up a chance for a drop to at least the weekly 20ema which is 404.03… a bigger retrace would be to the 385.9 or 385.21 demand. However, outside of a black swan I would be shocked to see us go that low… most likely scenario is a retrace to the 390-400 area where we could actually establish a new higher demand (support) in order to propel us back to the 412-416 area. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

This daily trend is straight barcode… no other trend to be had here… WE actually for the last 6 trading days have CLOSED within the same $2.99 range… that is a very tight range. 

The most bearish thing I can take away from this is that we now have a 3 point touch blue resistance line and did lose the support of the blue 3 point support… this opens up the potential to touch the support line for the bigger black rising wedge. That support sits at 408.2 for Monday. However the biggest bullish thing I can see here is that we have now for 3 trading days in a row bounced off the daily 20ema and closed over the daily 8ema. 

With this bearish engulfing daily candle and rejection off resistance/ losing support I would personally favor downside with a target of 408.9.

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/red74ovktgza1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a28c030558af3dedbacf44bfaebfc8c546743a8

A completely uneventful weekly chart here… we are still closing within the same $4.35 trading range for the 5th week in a row and we are still in that bigger $9.7 range for the 7th week in a row…

Now this rising wedge is about to come to a finally support test… 410.61 is that key weekly rising wedge support. If that line breaks then that would in my opinion indicate a bigger sell off is about to start. WE also have a nice carrot top (v-top) forming here too. We actually have an extremely tight breakout/ down triangle here on SPY weekly with support at 410.61 and resistance at 411.78. 

One very real scenario here is that we are going to see a fake breakout/ down and continue to range here.. I still personally would not be going long or short until minimally this $4.35 range is broken. 

SPY Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 416  
 Demand- 411.9 -> 385.9  
 Support- 411.6 -> 407.1 -> 404.4  
 Resistance- 416 -> 422

Now this daily futures chart actually shows a much different story… we actually today with this sell off managed to reconfirm 4153 as a KEY supply/ resistance. This supply is so important and strong that I actually am going to highlight it with a different style line… we did managed to close under the 4135 demand (support) too. With this 5 closures between 4133 and 4154 finally being broken there actually is a bigger chance of a sell off here… 

Our downside target would be 4074 on any major sell off. However, our upside target would be 4154 then 4190/4198 IF we managed to have a hefty bounce Monday.

The futures weekly chart also shows bearish reversal conditions now too… I would have liked to see a closure under the weekly 8ema but we did retest 4173 supply (resistance) on the weekly and to the point rejected it. Our target still once again remains 4054 on a weekly time frame.

The futures daily chart does make me feel and want to be far more bearish then SPY… We did manage to close below the daily 20 and 8em and closing under that 4134 support area. One other thing is that we perfectly rejected that blue resistance line making it a 4 point (extremely strong) line to watch. We also lost that 3 point support line. The final support now is the black rising wedge support at 4105 on Monday and the blue resistance would be 4160 on Monday.

Futures weekly in my opinion is showing a far different and far more bearish chart then SPY… what I am seeing here is that we are now closing below that month long range support of 4138. We did attempt to close under the weekly 8ema however, that eod push up of course stopped us from doing that… 

Our breakout triangle support is 4125 and resistance is 4140.

One thing I have highlighted here is that the 7 week post JPM collar (quarterly) roll is next week… now what USUALLY happens on week 7? Well usually what ever trend (Currently bullish) we are in will see a sizeable retrace from weeks 7 to week 11… 

Now when we keep in mind that there are perfect spy/ futures weekly bearish reversal conditions and that our breakout/ down triangles are coming to a point we very well might finally be seeing the top of this market… IF you believe in historical trends this is our opportunity to short. One thing to keep in mind is that occasionally week 7 will be the peak and the retrace doesn’t happen till week 8… I have a bigger target of 4000 for futures if this trend was to hold true… So far this trend has been a solid one to watch since 2022. 

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d6499egntgza1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=22767f4e88559d7a5a2e2d0a7694eef74106c1b7

Tough trend here on the VIX as we actually broke through both support and resistance of the short term triangle… so we redraw that and re-evaluate next week… we are seeing that this 16.8 area is becoming a major support area… WE did once again fail to break through 17.72 though.

We should watch these two key levels for a direction… I will say from a volatility/ iv/ price action stand point I am actually seeing further downside on the VIX for now…

The biggest thing I have said im watching for is the DXY recovery and 10YR breakout… we have part one which is the DXY breakout and holding that breakout… the last step is for the 10yr to breakout…

We are truly about as close to the top as we arguably are going to get… the signs are not 100% aligned yet… but there are a lot of things aligning that a sizeable correction is inbound.

Last week I put in my best week of profits for 2023 and I was 100% not trying to chase those gains as I know that is how people put themselves in a really bad spot and start taking poor trades and not securing profits… well after a very painful Monday and Tuesday I was able to secure my now most profitable week of 2023 again. 

Today was a great day of trading that I couldn’t have been any happier with… I have really struggled the last few Fridays of trading but I was able to with this range finally adapt to it and truly exploit it. 

After a terrible February… I have now put in 5 green weeks in a row and have been green for 8 out of the last 9 trading weeks. 

This market continues to be an extremely difficult one to navigate but everyday that SPY throws us a curveball and these markets do something new and unpredictable is another day we are learning and becoming better traders… Remember everything we learn now in this terrible bear market is information we will use to become that much more profitable traders in the next bull market.",2023-05-12

"It turns out that markets didn’t really care too much about PPI and jobless claims and we pretty much once again found ourselves in a miserably small range. This time we found ourselves in a $2.46 throughout the day… we did actually end up having a decent amount of volume at 70mil as of writing this… We have officially closed our 4th doji in a row and our 8th doji out of the last 9 trading days… 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

We still find ourselves in this same range and we have not been able to breakout of it for over a month now… 

We still are imbalanced for now as we are closed over the previous established supply without making a new demand… currently the way price action reads is that if we are able to establish a higher closer tomorrow we actually could establish a new demand (support). However, honestly right now we are in the chop zone and there is absolutely no direction and i feel fairly confident when I say if anyone is playing a long or short then its just a guess… 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ngfep30w9za1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fbc2e56e4e931279028a328b81b638b117a46dcb

On SPY daily we actually have two major patterns to watch… the first is the black diamond pattern and the second pattern is this blue breakout/ down triangle. As of right now key support tomorrow is 411.24 and key resistance is 413.7. If one of these levels breaks we could be eyeing a much bigger move in that direction atleast until the diamond support/ resistance is tested and broken. 

As of right now we are riding the support of the daily 8ema which should and could allow for further continuation to the upside… but as you can see much like intraday now we just are finding new ranges to trade within and we have no continuation to the upside or downside. 

From a weekly stand point of view… bears want a minimum close under 411.87 but really under 409.5 (weekly 8ema), however, bulls would prosper most with a closure over 416 minimum. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 411.1 -> 415.6  
 Demand- 405  
 Support- 411.9 -> 408.9 -> 408  
 Resistance- 412.8 -> 414 -> 415.7

**FUTURES SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Pretty similar story here on futures as we are now wedged right between the 4153 supply and 4135 demand. Favoritism would go for a new supply to be confirmed and possibly if we get a bigger red day tomorrow we could re-establish 4153 as supply (resistance) which would be extremely bearish… 

However, if we break out tomorrow there is a chance we could push up to the 4190/4198 supply area and attempt to establish a new higher supply before coming back down. 

Currently we are in the process of finding the next supply (resistance).

Futures also turned its 4th doji in a row in today… however, we have a slightly different structure with a rising wedge but inside of that we are eyeing a real nice breakout/ down triangle. 

Key support is 4134 and key resistance is 4165. Whichever one of these targets is broken we should expect a continuation of that into next week. As of right now there is a pretty equal weighted case of dumping through 4134 and breakout through 4165. The technicals really do support both. This double bottom off 4134 with a follow up double top off 4153 would give me a bearish bias for tomorrow. However, this 4134 and 4153 levels are both extremely strong and important. 

From a weekly stand point the bulls want to see this close minimally over 4192, however, bears would be cheering for joy with a closure under 4137 but ideally under 4128. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4153 -> 4190  
 Demand- 4135  
 Support- 4134 -> 4110  
 Resistance- 4153 -> 4180 -> 4192

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h6enjyj1w9za1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=45fc4761c0a060e7c5630978cf6c209dbdb0c8f2

The VIX continues to fight right about this 16.96 (call it 17) area and that has been a major support area for the last 4 trading days, however, we have now attempted to turn that into resistance. If this is the VIX turning 17 into resistance then the favoritism would be to the downside not the upside here for VIX which would give a bullish push up to SPY. 

I am not too worried about the white falling wedge as that is not a super strong line yet… however, this red support line which makes a real nice breakout triangle for this blue falling wedge is one to watch… that support lies at 16.65 tomorrow… IF we lose that support then I would see this as a bear flag for the VIX which means the VIX likely heads back to the 15s next week and SPY up to the 415-420 area. 

**10YR YIELD AND DXY**

&#x200B;

Now if you have been following my posts for a while you know the one thing I am watching for is tech to sell off… why? Because every single sell off for really the last 2-3 weeks has been led by the tickers in SPY/ DOW not by the NASD… so until tech finally shows weakness… we are stuck in this trend… one of the biggest things I am looking for is the breakout strength recovery of the DXY… as of today we FINALLY broke this two month long falling wedge… now this might be a failed breakout… however, as you can see by the curling upward EMAs.. this is looking like a heavy consolidation before a move to the upside… I will be watching for a move over and closing over the 102.196 area… IF and when that closure happens that should signal a breakage of the consolidation and move to the upside…

DXY regaining strength finally should take tech down finally… 

We might into next week see TECH start its sell off… 

The 10YR yield has not quite recovered yet and continues to show weakness and is just basing in this 3.306% to 3.607% area.

Today ended up being a REALLY great day… I am sitting just over my weekly goal as we head into the last trading day of the week. I did struggle a little bit this morning but by id day I found my groove and was able to capitalize on some solid plays… I did give some gains back at the EOD with that terrible chop we found…

These tight ranges and low volume days are becoming the norm… it is officially time to adapt, overcome and win with these types of days… 

Looking forward to the last day of the week and finishing off strong…",2023-05-11

"So SPY/QQQ calls got it ;)

Serious: Yea I'm sitting on 10 5/17 406 SPY puts and getting reamed by it. Yet, markets remain bullish and trying to go on a bull run. I went into this position thinking that the debt ceiling meeting tomorrow would have no results and panic would start to trickle in. But, that's been postponed and somehow that's interpreted as bullish. Simply put, this market is taking both good and bad news and putting a spin on it and claiming it's good news. Therefore, calls are probably the actual plays to follow thru. I'd suspect we'd might even go on a bull run next week just because everyone's thinking that there's no way we'll default on loans.

"I've been lurking and reading what you post for a long time but I've finally come to the point where I need to ask a question. Apologies if it's dumb but here it goes:

My basic understanding is that SPY is an ETF that tracks several stocks and moves up or down based on the valuation of those stocks and their percentage of the ETF.  Since AAPL and MSFT are more heavily weighted within SPY, the movements of those stocks affect SPY more than others.

That being said, if SPY is simply an ETF, why is it that you have a ""trading strategy"" based on it's movement and patterns? Isn't the movement simply based on it's underlying stocks and it doesn't have any kind of set pattern that's tradeable? To me, it looks like it's completely random.

With all due respect, with all of the trades that you place in a day, it simply looks like you're lucky some days and some days you're not. You might see a ""pattern"" or ""resistance"" or ""support"" and place a trade based on it, but it might not play out 100% of the time based on those factors because the ETF is simply moving up and down based on the underlying stock movement.",2023-05-11

"Well this was an impressive day to say the least and here are my very short and simple thoughts… 

The market once again does NOT believe JPOW and with the psyops of the banking issues market forgot and thinks banking is safe now… What we are seeing here is a front running of a pause… however, I think come Wednesday next week when we get CPI markets gonna get humbled… and in a big way…

&#x200B;

Based on what we are seeing (I don’t have all the Bloomberg estimates though) but as of right now minimally we are going to get a CPI YoY unchanged or upside miss… in addition CPI MoM will once again rebound in a big way… This is in my opinion the catalyst that the market needs to start a true sustainable leg down… why? Because its not a short term reaction… a rebound in CPI starts a trigger of many different things… the market has to price in the fact the fed is NOT going to pause, it has to price in a 25bps hike, has to start worrying about CPI pushing back up which causes a 25bps rate hike which puts more pressure on these banks and could cause more to fail… this in my opinion is the Armageddon… 

However, IF by some miracle we scrape by with a CPI YoY that comes in at 0.1% lower than previous YoY… I truly think nothing outside of a true financial system collapse will keep this sustained below 405… We honestly would be on a path back to 430-440 if CPI comes in lower than expected… 

**BRONTOSAURUS** 

What is a bronto day? Essentially what it is is a day where there is far more buying then selling… one where VOLD (which measures the up/ down volume of the NYSE) prints only green candles all day long… 

Today if we look at VOLD on the 1minute chart there was only 35 red one minute candles all day long. That means of the 390 minutes the market was open only 35 of those minutes was there more selling then buying happening… Even more incredible on a 5min time frame… there was NO red candles all day long… I can not remember a day this year where we did not see no red 5min VOLD candles I actually don’t even know if that happened in 2022…

If we objectively look at the supply/ demand chart what are we seeing? We see a VERY clear defined range from 404.3 to 417.03… that’s exactly a $13 range that we have officially traded within since March 31st… 

Today we did establish as I was suspecting a new demand at 405.06 just over that 404.03 demand… this should be come a very strong support area and one that I would be surprised to see broken without a lot of news or data/ volume to support it.

Right now we did not put in a new supply or demand on the weekly time frame. So after establishing 416 supply (resistance) last week we have now come down to retest 411.87 demand (support) and have managed to close over it… 

As you can see the last 4 weeks of trading have all closed within about a $4 range… that’s a very tight range.

After what looked like the worlds most convincing sell off beginning we had that very bullish hanging man reversal daily close yesterday. I was afraid that was going to be the end of the sell off and sure enough here we are right back in that 404 to 417 range yet again. This is now our 2nd failed break down bouncing off 404.3 both times. We are coming into this 412-416 area which has become heavy resistance every time we are here… 

One trend I want to point out is this two days short covering rallies that we have been seeing… generally speaking we have these back to back days of huge green extreme bull momentum days followed by the 3rd day being a doji/ reversal candle which then leads to a sizeable sell off… This sets us up almost perfectly for another green day Monday up to that 415-417 area followed by a doji candle then Wednesday CPI comes in hot and we start an aggressive sell off and attempt to finally close under 405 and push to 390. 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

What truly is incredible about the weekly time frame we have now closed 4 weeks in a row within about a $4.3 range. That is some incredible consolidation. 

This is our second week in a row to hard bounce off the weekly 20ema and close with a doji candle… actually this is our 5th weekly doji candle in a row… 7 out of the last 8 weekly candles have actually been dojis… 

These massive downside wicks on the weekly do make me feel far more bullish than the daily does. I actually do see a scenario here on the weekly where we could push to 428 EOW… If we get a good CPI print I would be shocked not to close over 428 EOW… however, if we get a bad CPI print I would be looking for 390-395 EOW. 

SPY Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 416  
 Demand- 411.9   
 Support- 412 -> 407.3 -> 404.2

We once again failed to take out 4040 and 4055 daily supplies this week… this still gives me indication that eventually Futures will retrace back down here and we are finding another longer DTE short opportunity on the horizon. 

We now have a new daily demand (support) at 4074 which takes out previous demand at 4085… our upside targets will be 4190-4198 next week.

We have no changes here to the weekly supply/ demand but we did close below the 4174 supply and still failed to come down to the 4055 weekly supply to take that out. There is potential for a push up to 4174 and 4284 next week… However, one thing I will say is that futures and spy weekly did NOT attempt to establish a new weekly demand (Support) here… with that being said… until that happens any upside should be expected to come back down.

Futures daily did rebound and too retook key 4095 pivot point along with the daily 8/20ema. We now are sitting right on this 4150 mid point of this channel we have been trading in. 

Upside potential give a move to 4190-4200 next week pre CPI. This rising wedge just seems to continue to break and then be recaptured.

Futures weekly has closed in the same 44 point range for a month now… and closed within a 67 point range for 6 weeks straight now… we are in some heavy consolidation here… 

One thing to note here and this has been pretty spot on is that generally post JPM collar roll (quarterly options expiration) we see a trend that holds or 7 weeks and then for 4 weeks we inverse that trend… currently that trend is up and has been up. Which means potentially in the next week or two we could finally see a top and start a month long sell off… That would nearly perfectly correlate with CPI tomorrow and a drop into the next FOMC meeting on June 14th… 

I mean lets paint the picture… a Monday pump and perhaps Tuesday pump/ doji to put in a new YTD high with a target of that 4300 calls collar… then we start a huge sell off for four weeks as market panics about CPI, banks, rate hikes, and FOMC… 

Futures Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 4055 -> 4174 -> 4284  
 Demand- 3920  
 Support -4148 -> 4095  
 Resistance- 4193 -> 4220 -> 4280

I am still learning the VIX1D so I wouldn’t take any trades off of this but something I found intriguing is that it closed out a reversal bullish (which would be upside move on VIX1D and potentially downside on SPY) pattern here.. This is a similar pattern we see on 5/1. We also closed our first futures daily gap. 

I am just interested in seeing how this plays out next week.

I have still been tracking data from VIX1D with closing prices, candles, etc. etc. and so far I have found no organized movement or any sort of edge for trading SPY. Early on the first few days there were some good correlations but not right now.

Currently the VIX after that massive move up yesterday gave back all of it and then some… what took two days to go up took one day to go back down and then some… That big doji candle yesterday was our hint of this move up today which did correlate with the bullish SPY daily close… This as I have said before usually is high probability movement. 

Now something to think about as we go into CPI next week… the VIX is currently sitting at that 17.1 pivot area… this might be the lowest level the VIX has traded at going into CPI… something to think about is lets say the VIX is at 15-17 going into CPI… can the VIX truly unwind that much more from here? In theory yes it could go back to that 11-14 range but that would be extreme in my opinion…

The risk is definitely to a downside sell off not an upside push… now they could always artificially pump the VIX the next two trading days and then a VIX drop/ SPY rally is more possible.

Today was a pretty meh day tough trading for sure… had that nice morning pump for the first 30-45 minutes of the day which was then proceeded by 3 hours of SPY closing in the same 75 cent range. By time we had the nice push up theta was eating so good it took a very impressive move up to get a decent win.

Thursday and Fridays remain the toughest trading days of the week so far along with the opening hour. 

Overall im very happy with the weeks results. Scalps were absolutely on point this week for me and I actually closed out my most profitable week of the year. 

Next week is CPI which should bring some more volatility and potential big movements… looking forward to it and looking forward to another week of trading. The last month or so has been really good to me.",2023-05-05
"I had nearly 300% gains in BRK.B calls I bought on the dip yesterday. Nearly 80% gains on DPST calls I bought yesterday right when WAL disputed the FT article. A good chunk of UVXY calls will expire worthless. Still a green day overall. 

I’m convinced nothing will rock the VIX at this point unless it includes the mega caps in a significant way. Options volatility on the rest of the SPX ‘tis but a flesh wound. The market cap concentration in less companies than I can count on my fingers feels like a future historical mistake, like something that will be pointed to as an enormous risk and everyone in the future will be thinking “how could they not know that would be a problem?”

I don’t feel like I have any clear plays for next week yet. That might not be such a bad thing, my only regret about FRC last week is that I couldn’t free up more funds to throw at puts.",2023-05-06

"This was a brutal day to trade. This felt like a few weeks ago where all the technicals were completely detached. Very tough trading today and honestly the fact that I basically broke even (slightly red day) is impressive as I felt like this was a big L of a day. 

This also reminded me of late 2022 where I would enter a position and almost immediately be down 5-10%... I haven’t seen that happen in a long time. IT was very weird and there were so many times I felt like premiums didn’t make any sense compared to the actual underlying. Frustrating day but a good reminder that we exploit the days that fit our strategy and we just survive the days that don’t without suffering major losses. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6z8le3psq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7680f4c2f65344ac291f0ebbf6131825af65ce68

As of right now surprisingly we did not establish a new demand today… we came very close (had we closed over 415 we would have)… so this means 1 of 2 things… first, this means that this was a fake breakout and that we tomorrow will see a massive rejection tomorrow to close at 410.2 or below… OR it means tomorrow we establish a new demand (Support) and we bounce. 

Now when we look at other things like the DMI which did start a wave up (bullish) and momentum still being bullish (not extreme) one would favor a breakout tomorrow to put a new demand in. However, this is anyones game for tomorrow right now. 

From a weekly supply/ demand stand point we are as of now set to make a new 418.59 supply and take out 416.08 supply. We also are holding the support of the 411.46 demand. 

The ideal bear close tomorrow is under 411.46 and the ideal bull close is over 416.08. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h2ge4o7tq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a311c28180c7002eec379a170a17acc732a95218

Price action wise we did manage to come back up and retake the daily 8ema resistance. The one interesting thing is that we closed a doji. Now this could mean that we reject and push lower tomorrow (would think more of an evening doji star pattern). 

From a price action start point bulls would prefer a close minimally over 417 and bears would prefer a close under 412.4.

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 418.78 -> 419.5  
 Demand- 410.2  
 Support- 414.6 -> 412.4 -> 411   
 Resistance- 417 -> 418.6

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9dje99ntq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4231c8854754e7512c41c0983c132a2faa5b4657

From a supply and demand stand point futures also did not put in a new demand here… however, we may see that happen if that moves up overnight. However, we would certainly need a daily close over the 4160 area in order to establish a new one. 

If we do put a new one in our upside target would be 4198. However, if this was a failed breakout/ recovery then our target would be 4127 again tomorrow and eventually 4075. 

From a weekly stand point we are set to put a new supply in at 4200 to take our 4192 supply. We are still bouncing off 4130 demand too. Bears want a close under 4130 and bulls want a closure over 4200. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5wtuyn1uq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9cf8e4946912109fdc651a74db695e51f5b489a7

On futures bulls failed to retake the daily 8ema here but did retake the daily 20ema. With a downside to upside doji this actually to me looks more bearish in nature and could see us with a sell off overnight and into tomorrow. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that we are going into a 3 day weekend and I believe with no debt ceiling being signed today that they will not be meeting until Tuesday. That could cause markets to want to sell off and be risk off into the long 3 day weekend (friendly reminder markets are closed Monday!).

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4216 -> 4209 -> 4055  
 Demand- 4198 -> 4128  
 Support- 4158 -> 4126 -> 4110  
 Resistance- 4172 -> 4188 -> 4208

**QQQ SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u8gy0jjuq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47dff0613041517124523b2b600c330de0397be3

Now this is where QQQ completely differs from SPY… here you can see we did indeed close out a bullish abandoned baby reversal… in doing so we put in a new 331.35 demand and now we are pushing upwards. 

The one interesting thing here is that we actually in gapping up like this are now seeing a possible bearish abandoned bearish reversal formed too… The daily DMI is waving up which gives further upside favor but if we got a hard rejection or drop tomorrow we actually likely will turn 339.72 into a new supply (resistance) and would look to retest 337.6 and possibly even 331.35 again. 

From a weekly stand point the DMI is very overbought here and we have still not put a new weekly supply in. We have our next major level at 361.85. Bulls would like a closure anywhere over 335-340 and bear ideally need a closure under 330. 

QQQ Daily Levels  
 Supply- 347.11 -> 337.6 -> 326.82  
 Demand- 336.37 -> 331.35 -> 325.99

**VIX** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e7hbrq5vq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3de28101d61d7ad29bd02af4019de508804ae47c

As I was suspecting the VIX did reject. I was thinking that closure under 20.08 would lead to a downside move on VIX and would also lead to an upside move on SPY. Now one thing here to keep in mind is that 18.86 is a strong support area followed by 17.97. If SPY bears can bounce us off 18.86 tomorrow again then we could look to close over 20.08 to end the week and head into a 3 day weekend. In doing so could see the doji rejection play out here on spy daily.

Honestly the fact that I closed just barely red today blows my mind as I truly felt like the whole day was a massive L. I have some pretty solid concrete rules for entries and exits. Today I just could not find a good entry to save my life. Today was definitely the type of day that if you wait for confirmation you already were too late and bought the top or bottom. There was also the lovely morning where SPY price action completely inversed what VOLD was doing. Honestly my thoughts on a day like today is that when big cap like NVDA is up 25-30% that the internals go completely wack and we are just left with poor technicals to trade. When you step back at the EOD it clearly was a range day today, however, it was not like our usual range days with clear set techncials for entries. 

I also a lot of times found as soon as I entered into a position that the premium almost seemed lagged and would instantly hit me 5-7%... there was a lot of times too where there seemed almost like a 3-5 second delay on price action versus premium. I watched a few solid candle drops on SPY and the put I had qued didn’t move at all and then all of a sudden it would be a $2 pump on premium. 

Tough day to trade but I look forward to a better day tomorrow.",2023-05-25

"As objective as one tries to be, confirmation bias is unavoidable in the absence of contrary evidence. I became convinced that yesterday’s NVDA AH price action was in part due to relatively low volume, and that it would most likely reverse course during normal trading hours. I have to wonder how much my current positions informed my future expectations…

On a positive note, on that conviction, I bought more NVDS close to the bottom yesterday AH and lowered my cost basis on it, it blunted my losses a little bit when I sold some this morning. Overall about a 25% loss on that bet.

Someone asked me about NVDA last week and whether I’m bullish or bearish. I told them, if I had to guess, it was going up to $400 and down to $200 in the next two years, but it is too much of a 🤡 stock for me to touch. I want to give last-week me a pat on the back and wag my finger at yesterday-me… (and at this point, I’m doubting my doubts about NVDA not being a $1 trillion company. There’s a serious possibility that I’m just not smart enough to see the big picture)

Humbling day. Some lessons learned. Glad I didn’t risk too too much. I exhausted my gambling budget for the rest of the month though, so I’ll just sit back and watch my other plays until I have some more money to light on fire.",2023-05-25

"Well unless you live under a rock you saw the media having a full tizzy today about WAL. Now lets paint the picture here… 

You have PACW last night publicly declaring literally hours after JPOW said the banks were strong and sound that it was infact not strong and sound. And that they were weighing their options… The market absolutely did not handle that news well. 

Amazingly the market continued to still buy the dip throughout the night. Then what happens? The Financial Times puts out a piece that it has hired advisors to explore its options… now the true question is how does something like this get made up? Or is it? 

&#x200B;

Lets think about this logistically… is a major media source like the financial times who is the worlds largest circulation fund group out there really going to put out a fake article? Would a company like them REALLY risk their status and credibility doing that? 

No I don’t think they would… so this is my thoughts… PACW is going to go under next as we saw last night after hours with the hit piece… now WAL is probably the next one to go down… perhaps it was meant to be released after hours today and the article got pushed too quickly… or perhaps the source leaked the info quicker than they were supposed to… we will never know the truth…

There are two ways to look at this… WAL is truly on the brink of collapse and are clinging to life with saying it was false or two that was a VERY purposefully released statement to cause panic and then they retracted it to save the market… Whether its right or not think about how much more easily that news will be digested when it actually comes true… Buy the rumor and sell the news… 

I truly don’t think we have seen the last of these banks collapsing.

Now we did not make any changes to supply/ demand today but we did come down and bounce pretty nicely off that 404.3 demand area and closed over it. There is a very real scenario here where we actually could find ourselves bouncing green tomorrow back to that 410 area which would likely established this 405.13 area as a new demand (support). If that happens then I would actually look for a rally into CPI next week back to that 415-417 area. 

However, if with the lackluster Apple move after hours and most importantly Unemployment rate in the morning… takes us down then we could look for a closure under 404.3 tomorrow which then once again opens up a move to 399.07.

On SPY daily here we DID finally close back under 405.2 support and more importantly we did break that rising wedge on the daily timeframe once again… Now this has happened once before last week and that led to an immediate bounce back to 415-417 area. 

I actually tend to favor a bullish move from here… We didn’t close out In my opinion a very bearish continuation candle. This is more of a dragonfly doji/ hanging man candle close which would more likely than not result in a push back up tomorrow not down. 

Bear case- we closed a full candle below the daily 8/20ema and actually closed below the daily 50ema for the first time since March 28th. We closed under 405.2 which is a major pivot point. We broke through a major support of the daily rising wedge. Daily IV and price action represent a bearish movement not bullish. 

Bull case- we did close that hanging man bullish reversal pattern today. With 404.3 demand being a nice support bounce here and seemingly the banking issues being over for now… without further fuel for the sell off realistically this could see a reversal back to the upside.

From a weekly stand point here… bears NEED a closure under 407.3 minimally but ideally under 402.5 EOD tomorrow… Bulls NEED a closure minimally back over 407.3 but realistically back over 411.6. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 399.1 -> 415.6  
 Demand- 404.3   
 Support- 404.3 -> 401.4 -> 399.9  
 Resistance- 407 -> 407.92 -> 411.5

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

A slightly different story on Futures here… so what im seeing is that we did end up losing 4085 demand (support) and actually are turning it into resistance now… We can within 7 points of that 4055 supply target I have been so longly waiting for… 

Now a few major differences here on Futures is that we have no put in 5 out of the last 6 days as “high volatility” candles… this in simple terms means that there is MAJOR fights in price action going on… in very simple terms… low volatility means that one side is sitting out (as in buyers easily are winning) and high volatility means that there is a high level of movement on buyers and sellers to get whatever direction we have… Why does this matter? Well it matters because the last time we had this many high volatility candles in this short period of time was the March bottom… now keep in mind high volatility usually signifies and end of a trend… what would you say the longer term trend has been? That would be bullish… so if that is changing well… we may be seeing the top then…. Now mind you this will never predict the timing of it and a daily timeframe can take a while to pray out…

Now on futures as I had mentioned yesterday we had lost the daily rising wedge support which signified that we should have seen the red day like we did get today. However, the daily candle structure remains notably different and is very important in its difference…

The daily futures candles is actually a gravestone doji… now this is where you have to know price action to see the difference here… many people assume that any sort of doji signifies an immediate reversal… however, that does not actually always happen. More times than not I would say a downtrend with a gravestone doji actually results in a continuation pattern. 

Few things to note here… this is actually SPY and Futures fourth red day in a row… that has not occurred since December 14th to 19th… I would be a little surprised to see a 5th red day in a row but from a macro news stand point of the banking issues I could see it happening… 

This doji candle today did come up and retest the daily 8/20ema and hard reject is and in addition to that we also have our first 8/20ema bearish crossover since February. Which if you remember started a nice 8% sell off on SPY.

From a weekly stand point on futures… Bears NEED a closure under 4055 ideally but minimally under 4095… bulls NEED a closure over 4095 minimally but ideally over 4110.

Futures daily levels  
 Supply- 4040 -> 4055  
 Demand- 4085  
 Support- 4074 -> 4055 -> 4040  
 Resistance- 4085 -> 4095 -> 4110

We did not quite get the 20-30% VIX reaction I was expecting though we were up around 20% at the peak of the WAL news… We are seeing two more rising wedges broken here and riding in a bull channel up now too… The question remains is there enough news to push the VIX higher or much like April is this 20.1 level where the fear dies? 

One big difference I see here is that the FG index is much much lower than last time the VIX was at these levels… with the FG index at 50… we have room to truly go either way.

I took a nice put swing based on some data that I had about FOMC meetings and post-FOMC day trends… I sized heavily down but still pulled out a nice win… I once again found myself getting ate up in opening hour… 

Today was a very tough day to trade… I felt like any time I finally found an entry the move was over, I also found myself more times than not waiting for confirmation that never came before the move happened. The very few times I did find confirmation I was left chasing premiums trying to get entries… Its terribly tough to enter a trade when SPX premiums are moving $1 at a time… 

Overall a good day of profits… This week right now im sitting just under 2x my weekly goal… one of my best weeks of trading this year… actually as of now this is my 2nd most profitable week of trading this year… If I am able to put in another good trading day tomorrow (profitable) I will be able to turn in my most profitable week of the year…

However, I have severely struggled trading Fridays lately so I do plan to go in lightly and nimbly using my tools…",2023-05-04
May be something is there in FT's article. Reuters is reporting that U.S. officials assessing possible 'manipulation' on banking shares. Something is happening.

"So calmly stepping back from the noise, what do we see?

The KRE direction is obvious. Almost too obvious in the short term. XLE, XLF down are similarly too obvious.

The defensive sectors were a mixed bag today.

If you loooked in the squirrelly corners of XLF the REITs were fighting back hard.  So was BTC and thus crypto stocks.

Conclusion.

The market is not fully yet terrified of risk, and the weak areas are due for relief.

So we could bounce on hard-hammered sectors where shorts are overweight. Crypto goes up until we hit or even slightly surpass the recent highs.

After that, we go down. CTAs are nearly max out on buys. They won't add liquidity. I really don't see the logic and liquidity for a rapid wave of corp share  buybacks. Even the Treasury is nearing the end of pouring liquidity into markets. Any big player scared by the bitcoin slamming recently, and wanting dry powder for what comes next, sells into that rally.


There really is only one source of liquidity left, other than the last dregs of retail money. And that would be if big money becomes scared enough of the debt battle that they decide money would be safer in high-grade corp bonds and securities than agency paper... and for the latter, frankly, they would do better internationally which weakens the dollar and adds pressure on the Fed to maintain rates.

So faced with two questions:

1. What will the market do in 1-3 days?
2. What will the market do in 1-3 weeks?

the first is always hard to answer. The second though, we're running out of ways for the swan song not to sound. Once either the CTAs start to sell, and doubly so when the debt ceiling is resolved/deferred and Treasury reduces liquidity by restoring its usual asset positioning, this market is effed with a razor-wired baseball bat inserted sideways and rotated.

And yeah, tough market today. Picked up 1% on an options play for XLE that I held a little too long (could have been closer to 3%). But I wasn't willing to let it sag and risk the overnight, I just wasn't in it deep enough to have any margin of safety.",2023-05-05

"VIX movement was disappointing today. I’m almost ready to accept that it’s not a technical disconnect, that it’s not being suppressed (wouldn’t ~~MM~~ *somebody* lose their ass on options if they were actively underpricing volatility?) and that the VIX futures traders just know something we all don’t…

I bought the dip on regional banks with DPST calls as soon as the WAL FT story was retracted. I’m feeling a bit nervous about the play though, with the current price and 3x leverage, we’re potentially looking at an ETF crashing moment if more bad news rolls in. Maybe I’m too optimistic about regulators and the administration, but I cannot make myself believe Treasury department will not make market rocking moves like insuring all deposits, suspending short selling, immediately buying back all treasuries at par. I think I’m just going to say “fuck it” and let my gambling portfolio blow up if the market moves against me. Or who knows, maybe my long volatility plays will make up for the regional bank plays. 

I know there was some bad news about PARA streaming and insurers are looking risky right now. But I was surprised how little AAPL earnings moved BRK.B. Maybe it was “priced in”.


Well, I’m going to lose a chunk if UVXY doesn’t hit $5 tomorrow.

PRE- CPI DAY! 2-13-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market analysis,2023-02-13
"  

Well lets get right into it… here is my overall analysis for tomorrow… I do suspect the highest and best probability of a payout comes from a miss tomorrow. 

CPI YoY is set up to come in over consensus and possible unchanged from previous  
 CPI MoM is set up to come in WAY over previous CPI  
 CORE YoY is set up to come in over consensus and possibly unchanged from pervious like CPI YoY  
 CORE MoM is the real wild card honestly. Based on the data I could beat, be unchanged or miss from previous. 

For me and I might be wrong I think markets are going to focus negatively on this MoM rebound and this will be the first CPI YoY that does not decrease by atleast 0.7% since November.  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wo0io1f9w0ia1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0b33507b2ea3be128bb910aae3773071b4e90f8f

Some very interesting things about this pre-CPI day… this is the highest the fear and greed index has been on the day before CPI all year long. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cns56rt9w0ia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5bbba15949534a7a0b3bf41ba16db0d2c7b50107

This is only the 3rd pre-CPI day all year long that the VIX closed a red day… the other two times were October which the VIX closed -0.12% and in May which closed -6.81%. All very interesting to be honest. 

The other very interesting thing about this CPI is that this is the first CPI with a new seasonal adjustment and weight calculation. We also saw this/ last week MoM and YoY CPI revised to the upside for the last few CPI prints too which is very intriguing.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uw3md2aaw0ia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e9f9ccd45b77b30180824345554c4fabe64e947d

As of right now with an IV of 40% and a PC ratio of 1.33 there is not much downside hedges put on and this is one of the lowest IVs going into CPI day that I have seen in a very long time… 

Tomorrow at 830am is going to be another very interesting day to watch. 

What impressed me the most was that the bulls pretty much straight ripped this green all day long today until 2pm. There is not a lot of risk off going into tomorrow. 

Okay lets take a look at SPY here… going to keep everything broad as we will get a better direction post CPI tomorrow and see where the cookie crumbles. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/arl55rpaw0ia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ba121985beade943fe413470b91ea3ec589705a8

SPY has a really nice black support line here but also a really nice blue bear channel formed so far here…

Overall the black support line sits at 407.3 and the blue resistance line sits at 412.8.

If we push to the upside we should expect a push to test a major resistance at 419.5 which is about 1.6% from here… IF we happen to get a huge 3% green day we could see as high as 425. Above 419.5 the next MAJOR resistance is 429.8.

However, if we get a big miss tomorrow and a red open/ day we are going to start looking for 405.3 support (about a -1.8% move) and if we lose that the next MAJOR support is 400 (-3.2%).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/37uhzg8bw0ia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=45243488077550a88778f940b0a48706ff3c69b8

Just as impressive here is futures that it opened and was trading -0.4% almost all night last night only to open green and close up 1.2% today.

We are going to be looking for upside resistance to be tested at 4210 (1.5%+) and 4310 (3.8%+) for our major upside resistance levels. However, to the downside the major levels at 4085 (-1.6%) and 4030 (-2.9%) red day. 

Again tomorrow post CPI we can see where we close out and go from there with some stronger trend and structure. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lyqouzqbw0ia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=35ced9aee86458dbe038d84f475adb5b2329b902

I honestly was kind of surprised to see Tesla red today… also today it spent almost 5 hours total today trading around 195. I haven’t seen Tesla hold that tight of a range for that long in a very long time. That was incredibly impressive. 

Major upside targets for Tesla are 202.4 (4%+) and 215 (10.5%+). Downside targets are 178 (-7.3%) and 163 (-16.3%). Granted I don’t expect 163 tomorrow but this week or next that would be my target. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k3xea8mdw0ia1.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=34646d8ac454c40ee5977b47c3ae889a41a762bf

Looking at the VIX what an incredible day for the VIX to open at 21.69 and fall al the way back to 20.37 to close at its LOD. An almost 6.5% drop on pre-CPI day for the VIX is really incredible and just shows how much bull hopium this market is holding onto right now… 

**Daily log-**

Honestly today was terrible day… I even called on Friday in my TA that we would likely close 410-414 area today… and well it happened and I didn’t believe it the whole way up… The red futures open and the huge VIX drop today threw me off and I kept waiting after the massive bull push this morning for a bigger drop that never came. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3jwt43mcw0ia1.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=02b485786a320ba37addefbedd277a736011dd78

The other issue is that because IV/ premiums are so high right now I kept talking myself out of calls saying “there isn’t enough upside to warrant this play” and then it would push up and I could had 5-10% a few different times. 

Definitely not my best trading day today… I look forward to CPI being over tomorrow and seeing what this market wants to do… If we get a lower CPI and markets receive it well honestly I have little doubt that this bull run doesn’t continue… outside of a black swan there just wouldn’t be anything in my opinion to cause people to sell… 

Realistically for me unless we get a hotter than expected CPI/ CORE I  just don’t see what is going to stop this market right now… JPOW couldn’t do it… three of largest stocks all missing on the same day couldn’t do it… FOMC couldn’t do it… im really not sure what WILL do it…",2023-02-13

"Well that was probably one of the most impressive V bottom recoveries we have seen on SPY in many months. A straight drill of $6 followed by a $5 rally. Absolutely an impressive but frustrating day to trade. 

That morning sell off has absolutely no chill at all… we straight dumped without even the thought or whisper of a pullback. That was one of the most aggressive downtrends we have seen in a while. What is even crazier is that we managed to recover it all…

Tomorrow morning we get a doozy of data… consumer spending/ persona income is going to be very interesting to see and not only that we get PCE and Core PCE… with the preliminary PCE numbers along with PPI/ CPI we should be expecting some pretty hot numbers to come in. I will be very interesting to see how the markets digest these numbers. 

The markets this morning despite lower jobs data and preliminary PCE hot reacted bearishly and then recovered it all… however, most of that might have been related to the nvidia pump.

The biggest thing to note on the daily here is the fight around the daily 200ema which sits currently at 399.93. Now if you take a look at the candle body resistance from January 23rd and candle body support from January 30th you can see that this 400.6 level that we closed on today is a big pivot level. Back in January when we had our breakout over 390 and 400 this is where we rejected for 3 days in a row, and then back tested support of before we broke out. 

Bulls continuing to defend this level could show some overall strength. 

However we have now closed 3 full candles below the daily 8ema which has not happened since middle of December when we were in the 380s. There is a very clear uptrend break, however, the question still remains of 390 or 405 retest first? 

My thoughts are that IF we get a good PCE beat tomorrow (as in lower than expected) then we COULD see a push back to retest daily 8ema/ 405.3 resistance. If we close below that level that would could be seen as a retest/ rejection and bearish for next week. However, a recovery back over 405.3 would be extremely bullish. 

IF we get HOT PCE and markets digest that negatively we could be looking at a bigger sell off that sticks. A closure under the daily 200ema and potentially off that 100ema near 396.6 that we bounced off today would be very bearish going forward. Now that we put in a green day here the chances of further sell off is greater. 

Key SPY Support- 400.6 -> 398.5 -> 396.6

Key SPY Resistance- 401.5 -> 403.2 -> 405.3

&#x200B;

Taking a look at futures daily here we actually have not taken back the daily 200ema and remain currently under neath that which sits at 4018. 

The biggest thing to note here is that futures lost that key 4030 pivot level on Tuesday and now have failed 2 days in a row to break through and hold over that level. As long as bears hold us under 4030 the downside is greater than the upside in my opinion. 

The biggest support area is that 3985 which is the daily 100ema though. 

Key Futures support- 4010 -> 3998 -> 3985 -> 3965

Key Futures resistance- 4030 -> 4055 -> 4085

Tesla continues to show impressive strength holding support off 197.1 for the 4th day in a row now… As long as 197.1 support continues to hold we shouldn’t expect a bigger sell off… yet… The last 5 days now have been pretty much a fight over the daily 8ema back and forth. IT is clear that the upside momentum has slowed, however, it is not quite clear just yet that the overall downside move is coming. 

Tesla is holding a nice 197.1 to 204.8 range and those should be the levels we watch closest for a breakout or breakdown. 

Key Tesla Support- 202.1 -> 197.3 -> 191.8

Key Tesla Resistance- 205 -> 209.2 -> 214.3

&#x200B;

The VIX finally came down and have a nice gap fill today. IT did maintain daily 8ema support also. The VIX doesn’t give us a whole lot of direction here at all. However, holding daily 8ema support should be bullish (as in markets will continue down). However if we break back under 21 tomorrow that push back to 405.3 resistance becomes even more probable.

Not too bad of a day trading today. I got burnt in that 4dte call this morning on a fake breakout pretty much moments before that massive $6 dump started. And honestly based on everything I saw at that moment and my rules I would take that play again. It was a good play just didn’t work out. 

Only other lost today came from getting burnt on this reversal. Historically speaking despite what SPY and 2022 wants us to believe… to full on reverse spy like it did today is actually not common and shouldn’t be expected… Take a look at Tuesday for example we had 3 or 4 moves throughout the day that looked extremely convincing of a big ole reversal upside that was just a put opportunity. I expected the same today and that 1pm double top rejection that then turned into a massive rip to the upside burnt me in puts. I had a few times I could have exited green but again I really did expect a push back to LOD and probability suggested the same. 

I was happy that I was able to close all of my 30dte (besides AMD/ Nvidia) at the LOD on SPY which was also the LOD on them. The only ticker I would have held longer or wanted to hold longer would have been Google. 

Overall looking at SPY weekly and tech as a whole weeklies (outside of nvidia) there is still a convincing case for downside to continues into the next CPI/ FOMC. However, we also have to take into account that we very well might just end up back in another $10 range from 390 to 400 or 395 to 405.",2023-02-23

"Window of weakness is closing for the bears...vanna and charm supportive flows come back next week full force. There is the old adage in the markets, ""time is not a bear's friend"". 

VIX had a huge red day, and bears have dropped the ball imo, unless they can put in a massive VIX spike tomorrow, I imagine we will consolidate in that channel you just said, 395-405 for the next few sessions then start a new leg up in March. The weak seasonality period is about to close.

The bear market rallies that turn out to be the start of new bull runs, are the ones that everybody doesn't believe. The ones where the market goes up, and it doesn't make sense at all. Where all the bad news comes in, and it the market lightly reacts to it. That's why this one looks like the one.

"Well I will give it to the CPI makers as I was surprised by the 4.9% YoY print… this is the first time Cleveland fed has had that much of a variance on CPI YoY in many many months… now I thought markets would love the 4.9% print… but it would appear that with this nearly $6 intraday dump that it in fact did not… so what are we worried about now? Recession? CORE inflation? Debt ceiling? Who knows… but this market is still stuck in a massive 1.5 month long range from 406.4 to 416. At this point until a WEEKLY candle breaks and closes below 406.4 or over 416 I find it very unwise to trade anything long term… there is also a 5 week long closing range of 411.6 to 416 on SPY weekly too… that’s an incredibly tight $5 range that we have closed within for the last 5 weeks (assuming we close within it this week).

Tomorrow we will get a CORE PPI, PPI and unemployment claims release… the interesting thing about the PPI prints is that this will be a possible bigger rebound on PPI/ CORE… last prints actually were one of the best ive seen with a negative print… so a rebound into the positives could be poorly received. 

I once again find myself thinking “what is going to cause this market to sell off?” but not only sell off… but continuously sell off… and with CPI coming in soft I truly outside of another bank collapsing do not see a reason to expect a sustainable sell off… however, I also based on this 5 week long and really 7 week long range on the weekly with extremely low volume also don’t see the support for further upside… We officially have found ourselves in the pain zone…

The one common theme that I continue to see here on these SPY sell off days that then lead to massive intraday V bottoms is that TECH never truly sells off with the market… in my opinion until we see tech show true weakness and truly lead the sell off… these dips will continue to be bought up.

Also did anyone catch this news… 24/5 trading on some stocks and ETFs for HOOD? How exactly do they plan to do this? I mean I totally would understand if they started doing SPX and futures or something… but how are they going to not only legally but logistically trade a stock or ETF after its stopped trading for the day? 

Sometimes I swear they are trying to break this market in half… at this point we might as well just do 0dte every day of every stock… sheesh. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Well I had mentioned I was surprised yesterday that we didn’t turn that doji candle into a supply… however, we ended up turning in a new supply today… however, this becomes problematic… why? Well simple… closing a daily candle over a supply that we just established is fairly imbalanced. So most probable that we need to do is eventually come back down to take out this 411.15 or at minimum close under it to attempt to establish a new demand (support) before we push back up. 

This imbalance here shows just how rangy and choppy this market has been. We still have strong support at 404.3 to 405 and strong resistance at 415.56 to 417… generally when a new supply is put in we favor a move to demand which would be 405.06… however, this imbalance actually would favor a move to 415.56 supply first. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

When I take a look at the daily here I honestly want to see a bigger bull flag forming here… but I also obviously see a notable rising wedge that we have been in since February/ march. 

Todays hanging man candle is a tricky one as it actually is a bullish engulfing candle too. One could infer today was a retest of daily 8/20ema support and with the bounce and closure back over it that we would push higher… but as hopeful as I was that today would FINALLY give some answers to a direction for EOW and EOM… I am once again left with more questions than answers… I personally don’t see a reason as I mentioned at the beginning to go long until we break the weekly range we have been in for almost 2 months. Until that happens we remain in some painful ranges… 

I actually wouldn’t be that surprised to see a pretty sizable drop in volume again tomorrow and more tight range trading of the $2-3 range. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 411.1 -> 415.6  
 Demand- 405  
 Support- 412.8 -> 410.8 -> 408.8  
 Resistance- 414 -> 415.7 -> 416.8

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Here is where I love following ES along with SPY as they especially with supply and demand show a different story… 

Now yesterday we made that 4152 supply… today we immediately turned around and established a new 4135 demand (support) and closed over 4152 supply (resistance)… to me this opens up an opportunity to go long back to 4190-4198 supplies. 

I based on futures… which I find to be far more clear and helpful in this choppy tight reversal happy daily ranges… would be bullish and look for upside until a new supply is once again established. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

Now taking a look at futures daily price action today actually turned into a 2 day bullish engulfing candle… granted this is a very long bodied DOJI… I actually see the huge daily 2 month long daily bull flag on futures but I also see a 5 day long bull flag on futures too… this would open the possibility to run back to that 4191-4199 area tomorrow or at least EOW. 

However, with data being dropped tomorrow morning we do not know exactly what to expect. I actually was fairly tempted to swing some calls over night but I know that for me I’m a better day trader than swing trader. 

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pdm9hwmcg2za1.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=59ae46905cc04e66cd254fe4240f53dda17bf87d

Well taking a look a here at the vix1d daily chart you can see that we attempted to breakout over the daily 8ema again and rejected. It also is notable that we are in a red bear channel and have nice slow blue support line… 

One could infer that until this down channel on vix1d is broken that we are stuck in more of this chop/ neutrally bullish price action. 

Now on the VIX you can see we did break trough the support of the red bull channel and have no formed a new white/ blue falling wedge inside of the major blue falling wedge. 

The current trend on the VIX is clearly down and realistically until that changes there is very little reason to expect sustained and long term downside on Spy… one thing that is notable though is that the VIX and SPY are correlating fairly well again. If and when the VIX closes under 16.96 support we have a nice little sell off shaping up down to that 15.72 support area which very well could propel SPY up to the 418-420 range. 

**10YR YIELD AND DXY**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7ngie35dg2za1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f4714b2f098ad73660bd586fd9e23fc35a50682f

One key thing I am seeing here is that especially DXY is currently showing is a massive downward resistance line that it has been trading within since the March 8th peak… one thing that I also believe will show the next leg down and sustain that leg down is a true DXY breakout which means the dollar regaining strength… it has absolutely gotten beaten up the last 2 months now. If and when that strength returns it should take TECH down with its strength… you can see much of the same trend here on 10YR which shows we are still in a massive downward move on 10yr… 

If and when these two in tandem breakout and the VIX breaks out… we might finally see a leg down… until then I still favor this neutral to bullish range trading.

Well today was a terrible start to the trading day… actually this is one of my worse starts to a week in probably a month or two… however, I was able to fight back after a terrible 1 for 7 win rate this morning… and managed to secure 12 wins in a row before I finally took an L during power hour. 

I went from being down about ½ of me weekly goal to no closing today up officially 50% of my weekly goal. 

Today was a attestment to a few things… 1. I should TRULY stop trading opening hour again… at least for a little while… the chop and reversals and volatility just are not allowing me to prosper anymore… and 2. No matter how far you are down and how chopped up you get IF you have a sound strategy and you stick to your strategies and rules.. in the end you will prosper. 

Don’t let a few days of bad trading or even a few hours of bad trading tilt you and make you break your own rules… Also you gotta realize that sometimes your strategy just wont work on certain days… my strategy follows momentum and continuation patterns which do not prosper well in low volume and tight range days.

Are the bulls or bears in control… 1-13-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Weekly Market Recap and Analysis,2023-01-14
"After the bulls had the perfect opportunity to take spy into the 400s yesterday with a great CPI print the bulls absolutely fumbled. With the opening this morning nearly 1% red many of us would have suspected that we were set up for a repeat of last CPI where we failed to break out and started a massive leg down. However, the bulls came back full force today with an impressive recovery to not only close green but to close higher than yesterday and to close back over the daily 200ema. So the question remains where are we? Where are we headed next?

**Daily time frame bull vs bear case** 

Bull case- today despite a massive retrace we established the daily 8ema as support once again. The daily 20ema has now crossed back over the daily 50ema, the daily ema crossed back over the daily 100ema also. IF this trend was to continue we could very well Tuesday end up with the daily 8, 20 and 50ema over the daily 100ema for the first time since January 2022. That’s correct… exactly one year ago (to the month) was the last time the daily 8, 20 and 50ema were crossed over the daily 100ema (currently at 390.5). The crossover is extremely bullish especially on that many time frames. 

The bulls broke spy back into the 390.1 to 405.3 channel and with out losing support of that 390.1 today when it was very possible we are finding ourselves looking for a push back to that 405.3 channel resistance. I mentioned last week that my pivot was 390.1 and if we hold over that we should look for upside. This is also the first closure over the daily 200ema since Decembers CPI. 

Bear case- despite the bullish appearance when we look at the last 4 days of trading have been very slow going. Most of these days have had an impressive sell off that and big morning volatility followed by a low volatility, low volume bull push. The momentum is definitely slowing. 

This is now the 7th time we have attempted to recover over the daily 200ema since August. Only two of those 6 previous times were we able to break through the daily 200ema without having a meaningful pullback. The first time we broke through it was in August with the help of CPI and the other time we broke straight through it was November 30th. If you remember that was the day JPOW did a interview and the markets roguely rallied 3% intraday. The days that immediately followed that resulted in a retrace. Actually looking back since January where we did lose the 200ema for the first time there are very few times we have broken straight through the 200ema unless we had a major catalyst (usually a fed day) when we tested the 200ema). 

There is also as I have mentioned since last week a cup and handle formed on the daily time frame that cup is represented by this blue rising wedge. If we lose that support (396 on Tuesday) we will see a retrace. Most cup and handles result in a 33% retrace which puts us down near 390-391 before we could see a bounce. That level is as you remember my pivot level. 

From a daily stand point bull to bear case… I favor bulls barely.

Lets take a look at the bull vs. bear case on the weekly. 

Now im trying to show this the best I can here with arrows but its tough cause it clutters the chart. No one will argue that 2022 was a bear market… however, while by a technical definition we are still in a bear market… the question remains will we trade line a bear market or will we trade like a bull/ neutral market. IF we are transitioning to a neutral/ bull market then we should see a push to a high followed by a retrace and then we should push to a new high (this is represented by the blue arrows). However, IF we are still in a bear market trend and the technical will follow as such then we look to the black arrows and will look for this week to be the short peak before the next leg down. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n2g0staf0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc4af825056419fe15ac14f2c132d906dc08e15d

The current bear market cycle (waves) is represented here in this chart… as you can see in general we start a leg down -> that is followed by about a 55.6% recovery -> followed by a 1.74x drop of the short peaks recovery -> followed by a 1.09x recover of the final drop. The average total drop from peak to trough is 18.6%. 

IF we are following the black arrows and IF we are still in a bear market trend and IF technical will follow we COULD see a total drop of 18.6% from the 410 peak the week of November 28th. That means we could see a low of 334 before this cycle is over… Total peak to trough bottom is about 61 days on average which would put us from the November 28th peak at about middle to end of February. 

If you believe we are still in a bear market and you believe in the cycles… now is your time to open march DTE puts… 

Bull case- from a weekly stand point here you can see that this is the first time we have closed a full candle body over the weekly 8/20ema since the week of December 5th. There also is a clear 8/20ema crossover. With the red channel I mentioned last week of 375.6 to 408.8 with 390.1 being our pivot… since we retook our 390.1 pivot point we SHOULD see a push to 408.8 before we see any meaningful retrace. The bulls also closed us over the weekly 50ema (by about 30 cents). Near 2022/23 bear market resistance is at 403.5 (1.2%) and officially ending the whole bear market is sitting at 417.74 (4.8%). Both are very within reach. 

If the bulls can break through 403.5 which is the new bear market resistance line I would effectively say the trend of higher lows and the bear cycle is over. 

Resistance levels- 398.5 -> 403.5 -> 408.8 -> 417.7 -> 427.5

Bear case- Despite what many are calling a bullish week we are actually seeing that bulls struggled almost all week long. The cycle analysis here says that from the now of 374.77 we should see a bout a 6.5% recovery which puts us at 399.13 before we would see the next leg down. The high of the week was exactly 399.1. If the bear market trend and cycles continue this was the short peak before the next leg down and bears are going to look for the next leg down of about 11.31% (353.9) within the next 17 days. 

With the banks this morning all giving pretty awful guidance and opening deep red (despite this intraday rally) we could look for big tech earnings which most of big tech will start presenting earnings the week of 1/23 to 1/27 and then more followed the week after. In addition on 2/1 we will have a FOMC meeting. Currently there is a 64% chance of a 25bps hike and a 36% chance of no bps hike at all… In my opinion the markets expecting a 36% chance of a 0bps is beyond insane and if and when jpow drops a 25bps or possibly a 50bps (he has said numerous times hes not ready to slow hikes).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c46wygvf0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=18fd345e38645c2f52afcfdc347c990363b62f8e

Here is a flash back to a few things JPOW said at the last FOMC… now could this negative MoM CPI reading provoke him to slow hikes and do a 25bps? Its possible… however, with CORE MoM going up there is definitely a chance JPOW sticks with a 50bps… a 50bps would send the markets tumbling (much like June with the surprise 100bps leak). In addition IF JPOW says we will NOT pause after this February FOMC that also could send markets dumping… the final piece of the puzzle would be CPI in February… apparently the metrics for how they calculate CPI will be updated for this next release. If CPI rebounds that also would send markets in quite the spiral. 

In short bears wanna see: bad earnings -> FOMC bps -> CPI rebound

Supports for bulls to watch- 390.1 -> 383.1 -> 375.6

Am I bullish or bearish? Honestly im Switzerland right now… I have been trying to be a bull the last 3 weeks and have been let down every single time. The biggest issue with the current trend is that the way the technical are presenting themselves is that we are getting clear cut setups and by the time the set up displays itself the move is done and we reverse. There is a severe lack of continuation. 

I am going to be taking a break from swings for a while until we get more of a sense of direction. The risk to reward has severely dropped.

Taking a look at the futures daily here the rising wedge is just beautiful. As someone who likes TA a lot… this is about as textbook of a rising wedge as there can be… realistically until we break the support of that rising wedge you should not be shorting this and I also with how tight the peak is do no think we should take a long here either. 

Futures the bulls for the 2nd day in a row closed over the daily 200ema. The last time that happened resulted in a -2.57% sell off..

On the futures weekly chart we are actually trading within a pretty massive diamond pattern… for those who don’t remember a diamond pattern is essentially a massive breakout or breakdown pattern. 

Much like our 375.6 to 408.8 channel futes has its own 3770 to 4090 channel. With the pivot being 3920 and bulls this week closing us over it this SHOULD present an opportunity to test 4030 next week. IF bulls can break through 4090 then we very well could see a push to what im calling the channel extreme of 4280. However, IF the bulls were to lose 3920 this week then I would feel more confident that this is a fake peak and that we are going to see a drop back to 3770. 

Something to keep in mind is that the JPM collar call is at 4030 too… and puts are at 3600.

Taking a look at Tesla let me tell you I was highly disappointed and got absolutely crushed playing calls on Tesla over night. The pattern looked beyond ripe for a huge breakout today and what happened? Well we got news that trumped the technical and caused it to go spiraling into the ground. Impressively Tesla managed to recover almost all of the loss before close. 

Effectively Tesla broke the black bull channel and broke through the rising wedge at the same time. 

https://preview.redd.it/om0vdlqh0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f053502047caa781bce56b9cfad83cea2b6ee6fc

New Tesla daily looks something like this… we now have a new daily red rising wedge and a 3 day long black resistance line. We also have the blue bear channel stick intact. Despite the fact that we opened nearly 5% red we actually managed to rally and close back over the daily 8ema. This is now only the 2nd time that here has been 5 closes over the daily 8ema since September. IF we were to close a 6th candle over the daily 8ema this would be the first time since September for that to happen. 

Support- 118.2 (red rising wedge) -> 116.4 -> 113.2

Resistance- 120.9 (black resistance) -> 122.3 -> 126.4 -> 129.5 (red rising wedge and blue bear channel)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5waq2l5i0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=28e92312d71222a166f655ca0397be64bad3ba72

On a weekly time frame we are actually forming a convincing V bottom here. This is now the 2nd week in a row to close higher. However as you can see we ended up closing right at that 122.4 resistance. 

So if we look at the last 3 weeks of trading 112.9 is clear support and 122.5 is clear resistance. We have essentially a 3 week and $10 long consolidation period here. The question is will the v bottom hold and we break out or is this a double top off 122.5 and we are headed lower…

We have two falling wedges here. We have the first black short term (Started in December) falling wedge that has a resistance of 112.8 for next week. That means unless tesla was to open -$10 Tuesday this falling wedge is broken. We also have the next falling red wedge at 124.2 for next week. If tesla can break through that level this wedge which dates back to September when this sell off began would effectively be broken. 

If we see Tesla break through both of these falling wedges I would feel fairly confident in a temporary bottom being put in and that we are going to see a bounce of some decent weight over the next few weeks. There is a case to see a rally into earnings which takes place on 1/23/23. If earnings were to come in friendly we could see a continuation rally, however, a miss on earnings is most likely going to result in the next leg down. 

Key weekly support- 118.7 -> 112.8 -> 102.1 -> 94.5

Key weekly resistance- 122.5 -> 150

Taking a look at the VIX… This is officially the lowest level the VIX has touched and closed below since 1/13/22… exactly one year ago today. 

The VIX has absolutely without a care in the world unwound. I still believe the VIX Is not a great metric anymore for making plays and I do not think that the pervious trend and previous ways we have used the VIX to trade SPY is valid anymore…

With that being said IF the bulls can continue the momentum on SPY we very well could see the VIX tract back in the 15s for the first time since 2021. My red zone on the VIX is 16.6 to 19.7. This is previous where the VIX has bottomed out all of 2022 before the next leg down for SPY has started. Highlighted by the blue arrows you can see every time previously it touched 19.6 or below we reversed and started the next leg down on SPY. 

So the question which I posed back up in the beginning is this… are we trading within a neutral/ bull market again and effectively will find ourselves using different technical than we did for all of 2022 OR are we still in the bear market and the previous trends/ technical from 2022 will remain valid…

IF you believe we are leaving bear market territory then we should continue to see the VIX unwind. Why? Well the VIX essentially measure fear… how does it measure that? Well it measures it by how many people are hedging with puts (aka downside protection). The more people with puts the higher the VIX goes. As you can see since October the VIX has steadily unwound and since the December CPI to present CPI we were trending down slightly but holding steady. Since the current CPI just printed we have unwound completely and even leading into it. 

So IF we believe bear market is over we SHOULD expect the VIX to return to its normal mean. Which prior to 2022 bear market would be 15 to 19.7 with a outliers above and below. Most of 2021 (after March) was spent within these two levels. We should effectively find the VIX holding at these levels and find SPY to trend slowly upwards. Remember we are not in a 2020 bull market/ QE market. 

However, IF you are on the side that we are STILL in the bear market and will remain there until 2023 is over or for at least the foreseeable future… then right now you are being presented with the opportunity to of a life time to start piling into puts. IF you believe this is the bottom of the VIX and that much like all of 2022 we will spike back to the 2022 bear market mean which is 23.8 to 28.3 then now is your buying opportunity. I would IF you are bearish and believe the earnings, FOMC and next CPI will start a bearish catalyst and bearish dump in the markets… I would recommend some March or June puts right here… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ua2iz7uj0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=30f357e9bd1c9992a9acb2633d4dfee4c45bf2d0

That leaves me… where am I at? What is my prediction? I remain under the conviction that we will for most of 2023 and possibly even into 2024 depending on the economy, recession, FOMC, CPI, etc. etc. trade within this 375.6 to 408.8 channel… I believe we will see the occasional outlier at 360 to 428 but any touches there will be short lived. I honestly believe that the bottom IS IN… I do think that 348.11 on October 10th WAS the bottom and will remain the bottom for the foreseeable future. 

The only thing that in my opinion would change my mind on that is IF we were to see back to back to back bearish catalysts. Bears are going to need the perfect end of January into February bear storm… they are going to need to see two weeks straight of big tech and heavily weighted companies miss on earnings AND give poor guidance, we also are going to need JPOW to have a backbone and give one last 50bps hike, after that bears need to see a rebound in CPI (especially CORE). This would be three big bearish catalysts from January 23rd until February 14th. That is 4-5 weeks of catalysts that COULD drive the narrative downward. 

If you remember the SPY cycle above I mentioned that the final leg down of this current bear cycle would end the end of February and COULD reach as low as the 330s. 

Personally I believe at some point we are going to get enough of a run and momentum to break through 417.74. That level is what signals that we are BACK in a bull market. However, I do not think we will just slow climb back to ATHs. I think 2023 and possibly even 2024 depending on what happens with the economy, recession, CPI, etc. etc. etc. will be very much so range bound. 

I also would not be shocked to see hedgies rally us just hard enough and just convincing enough over that bull market line to trap people in calls and pull the final downside hedges off before we finally see the last leg down put in. 

Also you have to remember that historically the bottom bottom comes AFTER the FED pivots… While we DID slow rate hikes from 75bps to 50bps and COULD slow to 25bps here in February… we have NOT officially pivoted until we get a 0bps… That at max will come at the March 22nd meeting. That means most likely if I had to guess the last leg down will be put in during the summer of 2023. The question is will we put in a new 52 week low or will we revisit the 360s and start the recovery. 

Something else that keeps me up at night (just kidding but it really makes me wonder) is that IF this truly is the bottom and this is truly just going to be range bound until we slowly start the next bull market… we have not had true capitulation… sure there was a few days in a row of huge sell offs in a row. Some really long streaks of red days in a row but I do not think we had capitulation. We also never got our VIX to 50+ Spike. The highest the VIX ever got was 38.94 on January 24th (very early on before we even were officially in a bear market). We also have not had a circuit breaker…. 

While there is no official requirement for VIX 40-50, a circuit breaker OR for capitulation (which could be seen as the VIX spiking or a circuit breaker)…. It would be very odd to see an official bear market like this without them. There was definitely some very convincing days in June that I would have thought had the potential though….

I unfortunately found myself on the wrong side of the news today with Tesla which of course being a 0dte resulted in a total loss. Today was my sons birthday and I was off most of the morning and by time I got back I just couldn’t find anything I really wanted to trade. Ended up taking a pretty sizeable red day today and unfortunately put my first red week of 2023 in too. 

Somethings I learned this week that I plan to implement going forward. 

This week is now the second week in a row where I had a great Monday and Tuesday and playing a major fed event like CPI or FOMC minutes has resulted in a significant loss. I used to play every major FED day (cpi, FOMC, FOMC minutes, unemployment data, etc. etc. etc.). However, the thing I am finding to become increasingly true is that I have been correct however the market has not reacted how I envisioned it too.. For example last week I played puts on Unemployment data expecting a full on -1% red open and I got the exact numbers in order to do that… and market algos decided that for the first time ever wages were more important than overall unemployment missing by a huge shot… Just like CPI my prediction for the actual CPI numbers was damn near perfect.. however, despite playing the highest probability play I could (a strangle) the markets decided on some of the best inflation numbers we have had yet to open flat. Going forward I am going to be stepping back from playing any big data days or big fed days. The risk to reward is just not there anymore. 

With that being said we have now reached some of the worst theta decay and IV crush that I have ever seen. 

IV crush- the one thing that an option player wants to see is HIGH IV after they are in a play… why? Because I high IV pumps premium prices AND means a huge move is expected… however, the issue lately on SPY is that the MM have priced spy options so damn well with premiums and IV that the reward side of the risk is very low. For example for the last two weeks now (especially this week) previous moves that would have netted 10-15% gains are barely netting 3-5% gains. I noticed this actually on a macro scale from about September until November previous scalps and level to level plays stopped paying as well.. Scalps used to be literal free money… as long as you had the direction correct and played the techncials correct you could net yourself a 15-20% win in literal seconds (think 3 seconds is my record)… however, now those same scalps are barely giving you 5% before premiums move against you. In addition with IV being so well priced when we do have huge data days the IV pumps so well on SPY that the move doesn’t give you anything. For example last week on that unemployment data I know some people played SPY calls and a near .8% move I believe it was on 0dte SPY contracts barely netted 30% on a swing play… a 0dte moving nearly 1% should EASILY be a 100%+ gain… 

The only plays lately that I find to be even worth while are weekend swings… I am not quite sure why (And I would love someone to chime in here… ) but I have noticed since thanksgiving weekend that every Friday into Monday (and especially into 3 day weekends) that the next DTE after the weekend IV drops into almost the single digits… however, nearly every single day of the week SPY has opened with an IV of 25-35%. For instance tonight the IV on 1/17 SPY puts and calls closed at 8.2% and 9.9%... that is incredibly low IV considering IV should open around 25-35% on Tuesday. The best risk to reward if you have very strong conviction for a move over the weeks comes in here… If I take a swing this is what I will look for is IV near 10-13% the day before and a VERY convincing technical move… otherwise the risk to reward on swings is shit again too…

Lastly is theta decay- I noticed that pretty much since November (when 0dte everyday started) the theta decay (and mind you there are other factors here but im just saying theta cause that’s what most call it when prems lose their value) has been extremely aggressive. For instance today… we had a VERY slow bull trend all day long moving us up. But the issue was that SPY would move up 50 cents -> immediately drop 40 cents -> move up 60 cents -> immediately drop 40 cents -> move up 50 cents -> immediately drop 75 cents -> move up 80 cents… etc etc etc… what effectively ended up happening is that every time we would push favorable you barely saw on a very short DTE (anything but 0dte) any profits, however, that move against you comes and by time price moves even more favorably in your direction your contracts value is less than it was at the same spot… I have noticed for the last 4 days this is exactly how premiums have moved pretty much all day long… I have barely most days been able to get any sort of sizeable win out of anything over 2dte because of this. And if you fail to take profits on the first push you are left either getting stopped out or left with even less profits the next time. 

Now add in this theta eating movement with the fact that we are seeing IV open at 35% and slowly all day long drop down to close out under 20% and well unless you have a VERY strong aggressive trend… 99% of the time you already lost just taking a trade.

We are in a very tough time to trade right now and honestly I do not forsee it getting any better. We have to weigh the risk to reward every single trade… we also have to accept that unless we see a big move coming and a bigger trend to play out that honestly you might find yourself sitting out some days and not even trading them. 

In the end its like I have said all of 2022… capital preservation is the number one goal until we truly are in our next QE fueled bull market. Until the markets slap that easy button again and we can open a 0dte at 945am in the direction of the trend and hold it with conviction until 3pm for a nice win… we are stuck in one of the hardest markets maybe ever to trade in.

I am in the bear camp for all the reasons you pointed out. An interesting fact about the VIX. Most people use it to measure fear. You pay the highest prices for stocks the lower it is. The higher the VIX the cheaper you can buy stocks.

Keep on keeping on. You are good at this! Thank you.",2023-01-14

"The next leg down has begun… 4-25-23 SPY/ ES Futures, and VIX Daily Market Analysis (MSFT and Goog Earnings bonus)",2023-04-25
"Well last week my price target was 409.19 SPY and 4116 ES and we have officially hit those levels!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5uwvhlhrf3wa1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=619012d082d701a322d4eef65ed5c799d19f001c

Now that we have seen one day of this… I will be very curious to see how the VIX1D does EOD with correlation to the next day. 

My next major target and potential source of a bounce on SPY is 405.2/ 4055 Futures. 

**MSFT**

Really nice beat there on MSFT EPS and revenue wise pretty much a sweep across the board. 

https://preview.redd.it/jw7iw44sf3wa1.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c9477c89b2145ba9a311b683fe8bffeb7e16c833

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d8vlz5psf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4f6a12cc2c9d5e5fff00ad5f302d9d69aa72b748

I did not play MSFT earnings as I just honestly generally do not play earnings… though I am considering a META and AMZN lotto play… but overall looks like MSFT is going to have a nice upside move. 292 will be a major upside weekly target and resistance for MSFT. 

**GOOG**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/83hw93atf3wa1.png?width=992&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e4c04264624e66459764d24f068a5a68d78454b2

Goog actually came in with a beat on EPS too and some pretty decent revenue beats… they also authorized an impressive 70 billion buyback too. 

I actually would have expected a miss on google and this is its first beat on EPS since Q1 2022. 

Puts clearly were not the play on Goog. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ujqrieptf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=617c013b9e09127920ec083070c1332f888da609

Taking a look at daily supply and demand here I mentioned how with the way supply and demand has been moving lately I would not be surprised to see us immediately turn around today and turn demandt back into supply… that is exactly what we did… 412 demand now becomes 412.62 supply. 

We also came all the way down and took our 409.73 supply finally. We did fall just short of 405.17 supply though. 

If we continue this sell off tomorrow our target is 405.17 followed by a bigger eow and into next week sell off to 399.07 supply. If we can take out 399.07 supply then I would be more confident in a longer term and stronger bounce to the upside. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfsvgz4uf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0a8b3eed4d3ac49dce5a5d073c7e9023684eeab8

SPY officailly has broken out of the 15 day long range of 406.6 to 415.6 with todays close. Not only that we closed our first -1%+ day since March 22nd. 

We also clsoed under the daily 20ema for the first time since March 23rd. One thing on SPY is it likes to back test the EMAs. Now I did think we could immediately turn around and reject that daily 8ema recovery from yesterday the bloody premarket made tahtjust a straight drop. We came dangerously close to hitting 405.2 today but we were not quite able to get there… I will be watching that level extremely close going forward. 

If we can break through and CLOSE under 405.2 I feel fairly confident in a sell off down to that 399-400 area. However, IF the bulls can hard bounce us off 405.2 and potentailly turn 405.13 supply into demand then I actually would favor a push back up to 412-416 leading into FOMC.

I wouldn’t be totally surprised to see an upside push tomorrow to retest the daily 20ema resistance. As long as we close under that I would remain bearish going forward. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 405.1 -> 399  
 Demand- 406.7 -> 409.2  
 Support- 405.2 -> 404.2  
 Resistance- 408.1 -> 409.1 -> 410.6

 

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cn0y4zmuf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=52b602bd5e45b4d4c6330e3ec9f90d5de581d7ce

Just like SPY futures immediately turned around and turned 4153 demand into supply (resistance) at 4157.

We did not take out any previous demands or supplies today but we did close below that key 4116 demand. We now have a fairly large gap in supply/ demand with downside target at 4040/4055. We also have a supply all the way down at 4015 that too needs to be taken out. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j9q4jh4vf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ab4c075fc3df71bb82c2e8fa65c0bdcc1a8cd788

When I said that futures could immediately turn around and make 4160 a double top looking at the TOS chart that is exactly what I was talking about. Actually this is where my love hate relationship with TV forms as I love TV for ease of charting but its price action is “oof” sometimes… as you can see on TOS futures closed a confirmed 4157 double top but if you look below its not an actual double top on trading view. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qjuww7lvf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=62d5ee3b6578d777af043683f9f27a517e17acd5

Now the biggest thing here to note is that we too did break out and close below the 4113 to 4178 channel that we have been consolidating in for 15 days… With a break down like this on futures and spy we should 100% expect a bigger move to be had. Now prior to MSFT and GOOG earnings being released we actually were setting up for a closure under 4095 which is a majorly bearish movement. 

I will look for a possible retest of the daily 20ema at 4125 tomorrow and then look for a continuation back and closure back under 4095. If bears can get this closed under 4095 I do for see that bigger push down to the daily 100/200ema at 4040/4055. However, IF bulls can bounce us off good earnings then there is a chance that we will see a push back to 4138 resistance before attempting to retest 4160-4198 area. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4160 -> 4055  
 Demand- 4116 -> 4005  
 Support- 4095 -> 4080  
 Resistance- 4118 -> 4138 -> 4160

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mjgdbl3wf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3795e3584990aa0aedbd1e0a5fd042b111e87916

The VIX had an impressive day today being up about 18% at one point. Now we always have to look at the WHY… why was the VIX pumping today and SPY dumping? Well FRC said it might sell up to 100 billion in assets… why does this matter? Well this shows that this banking crisis is far from over… Markets needed a reason to sell and we might have gotten that reason finally…

Now we did see a pretty sizeable drop on the VIX by EOD but if we continue to see more banking issues we very well might see continuation to the downside despite what the big tech earnings do this week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ockv1kkwf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e29d8c3f7e1eb1576552bfe94a569f14767e6e7

Whats actually interesting to me today is that probability of a 25bps rate hike next week dropped from about 88% to 77% today… people are now beginning again to think that JPOW is going to pause because of the banking crisis. 📷

Even more wild is that we are beginning to price in a CUT in June already (this of course assumes we get a 25 bps hike next week).

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

I had a field trip with my daughter today so I wasn’t able to trade but I was able to close my long term 405 puts pretty much at the LOD. I wouldn’t have minded holding these but being OTM and I was heavy in these I wanted to close and reposition. 

I am now in July 21st (87dte) 408 puts… my ultimate target for these is 399-400. IF we happen to get a rogue rip back to 415 I will happily average down there again. 

Looking forward to trading the rest of the week. I am already sitting just below my weekly profit goal.",2023-04-25

I am gonna probably buy a crap of calls end of day. After CPI we should see a nice push up due to technicals and midterm election pump. This is all so easy. This has to be free money at this point. Calls and we will all be billionaires. Like we might as well. After SPY hits 400 we will be retesting 420 which is the degenerate number that we all looking for. Godspeed.,2022-11-09
