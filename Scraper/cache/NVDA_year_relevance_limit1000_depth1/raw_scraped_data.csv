NVDA - Saw Jensen’s Commencement Speech and very impressed,2023-05-29
"Nvidia almost died 3 times in its 30-year history.

CEO Jensen Huang shared these near-death stories at a commencement speech last night.

Here's what he said:

LESSON 1: Have the humility to confront failure and ask for help

Nvidia's first big 3D chip contract was for Sega's new game console. 

From Jensen:

""After one year of development, we realized our architecture was the wrong strategy...

I contacted the CEO of Sega and suggested that they should find another partner. But I also needed Sega to pay us in full or Nivida would be out of business. 

I was embarrassed to ask. The CEO of Sega, to his credit and to my amazement, agreed. His understanding and generosity gave us six months to survive.

Confronting our mistake, and with humility, asking for help, saved Nvidia. These traits are the hardest for the brightest and most successful.""

LESSON 2: Endure the pain and suffering needed to realize your dream

In 2007, Nvidia announced CUDA, a new computing model for GPUs. 

From Jensen:

""Creating a new computing model is incredibly hard...Nvidia's profits took a significant hit...

We suffered many years of poor performance. 

Our shareholders were skeptical of CUDA and preferred we focused on improving profitability. But we persevered...

This journey forged our character to endure the pain and suffering that is always needed to realize a vision.""

LESSON 3: Make sacrifices for your life's work

In 2010, Nvidia had the lead in the mobile chip market. But then the competition came in.

From Jensen:

""The phone market is huge; we could have chosen to fight for share. Instead, we made a hard decision and sacrificed the market...

Nvidia's mission is to build computers to solve problems that ordinary computers cannot. 

We should dedicate ourselves to realizing our vision...

Our strategic retreat paid off. By leaving the phone market, we opened our minds to invent a new one.

To retreat from a giant phone market to create a $0 billion market was a risky move, but it paid off. 

Retreat does not come easily to the brightest people, yet strategic retreat, sacrifice, and deciding what to give up is at the very core of success.""

//

Jensen wrapped up the speech with this:

""Run don't walk. Either you're running for food, or you are running from being food:

1. Have the humility to confront failure and ask for help.
2. Endure the pain needed to realize your dream.
3. Make sacrifices for your life's work.""




Damn, this give speech gives me Steve Jobs vibes. I am even more impressed with Nvidia’s leadership now as a shareholder.",2023-05-29

NVDA Technical Breakdown Q2 2023,2023-05-29

Investing in the stock market involves a significant risk of loss, including the risk of loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results. You should conduct your own research and consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.**

**Disclosure: At the time of this publication, I, the author, personally hold a position in $NVDA. Please conduct your own research before making any investment decisions.**

&#x200B;

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), a leading chipmaker and AI company is on a tear recently, with its stock price hitting $389.46 on May 26, 2023 - a nearly 30% jump since the last earnings report. Contrastingly, the broader economic, geopolitical, and social environment send signals of uncertainty. The market's volatility index (VIX), which currently rests at a relatively low level of 17.95 hints at an imminent  downturn, indicating complacency among investors. However, it's important to remember that markets are complex and frequently behave contrary to expectations.

While the broader market seems calm, one sector, in particular, is leading the trend: the technology sector with chipmakers and AI companies are seeing a significant uptick.

**The big question is, should we dive in or wait it out?**

Before we get into that, let's be clear, this analysis is not financial advice. It's meant to shed some light that help us make better-informed decisions.

Let's get into it!

Nvidia's fundamentals are robust, but that's not our focus today. With the company venturing into high-growth territory and emotional responses overpowering rational data, we're turning our attention to technical analysis for potential insight into future movements.

To begin, we can see the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for NVDA is at 83.62, suggesting an overbought condition, which is typically considered when the RSI is above 70. This high RSI value might imply that the stock is due for a short-term pullback, as observed in NVDA's historical performance.

In the past, NVDA's RSI crossed the extreme overbought line of 80 five times: on Feb. 19, 2020, Sept. 2, 2020, July 6, 2021, and Nov. 8, 2021. Each time this occurred, there was a short-term pullback in the stock price ranging from 5.0% to 38.9% over periods from three sessions to a month. However, in each case, the stock reached a new record high within three months of the pullback.

Previously, a pattern referred to as bearish technical divergence was observed, which suggests that rallies are taking more and more out of the bulls, leaving them vulnerable to bear attacks. This pattern emerged in Nov. 2021 when the stock kept rising to a record $333.76 on Nov. 29, 2021, while the RSI was actually trending lower to a sub-overbought reading of 69.53 that day. This was followed by a significant 11-month bear market, where the price plunged 66.4% before bottoming at $112.27 on Oct. 14, 2022.

NVDA's price is currently close to the Fibonacci resistance level of $394.8. If it breaks this resistance, the next key level to watch would be $483.48. On the other hand, if the price declines, the Fibonacci levels of $364.09, $360.93, and $339.98 could provide support.

Fibonacci extension is another technical tool to identify possible resistance.The most common Fibonacci extension levels are 1.618, 2.618, and 4.236.

Let's calculate the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level for NVDA:

1. Subtract the low from the high to get the difference: 394.80 - 108.13 = 286.67
2. Multiply the difference by the Fibonacci ratio: 286.67 \* 1.618 = 464.02
3. Add the result to the low price: 108.13 + 464.02 = 572.15

However, please note that these levels are theoretical and while they can often serve as areas of support or resistance, they're not guaranteed to hold.

In summary, NVDA has been experiencing a strong upward trend across all these periods. This is accompanied by high trading volumes, suggesting robust investor interest. Given the strength of this upward trend and high trading volumes, it could be surmised that the market sentiment towards NVDA is bullish.

During the past 13 years, the highest PE Ratio of NVIDIA was 224.98. The lowest was 13.68. And the median was 39.94

&#x200B;

**So, where do we stand?**

Nvidia's underlying fundamentals are strong, yet the recent trading frenzy seems to eclipse these fundamental values. As emotions run high, we're observing price action that is increasingly detached from the stock's intrinsic worth. Anticipate considerable volatility in the coming month, which may lead to substantial capital losses for those choose to trade this stock even though overall sentiment is bullish. That being said, our enthusiasm for NVDA and AI at large is unwavering. We're extremely bullish, and we foresee plenty of upside potential. Despite this, due caution is warranted. Here are our projections and perspectives for the ensuing month:

&#x200B;

**Bear Scenario:**

While we've discussed the bull case for NVDA, it's equally important to consider the potential downside risks. If we look at the Fibonacci retracement levels, $364 emerges as the first potential support level that could hold during this breakout rally. Moreover, during a bull run, the 5-day moving average often provides a level of support while 10-day MA could signal possible weakness, so it's essential to keep an eye on this as well.

One notable aspect of NVDA's recent price action is the significant gap up. This has created a large area that could be 'filled' if the stock were to pull back, which is a common pattern in technical analysis. As such, we could see NVDA potentially retracing to the $320 level, which, given the gap-fill scenario, could serve as a very strong support level.

These are all potential scenarios that could play out in the near term. It's important to monitor these levels and adjust our investment strategies accordingly, always being mindful of both potential upside and downside risks.

&#x200B;

**Bull Scenario:**

On the more optimistic, or bullish, side of the spectrum, we draw upon Tesla's impressive P/E ratio of over 1,000 during its significant rally two years ago. If NVDA were to reach a similar P/E ratio, this would translate to a stock price of $2190. However, considering NVDA's near trillion-dollar market capitalization and current growth rates, reaching such a level would be extremely ambitious. At this stock price, NVDA would have a market cap of an astonishing $5 trillion.

For perspective, Apple, currently the world's most valuable company, has a market cap of $2.7 trillion. If NVDA were to reach the same market cap as Apple, this would equate to a stock price of $1095. However, the market often anticipates such significant milestones and investors may start selling before reaching this psychological barrier.

As NVDA begins to show signs of a meme stock momentum, it’s essential to draw upon historical precedents from similar market movements. Notably, Dogecoin experienced a sharp downturn after it nearly reached the much-anticipated $1 target, peaking at $0.74. AMC's stock price exhibited a similar pattern, retreating after it hit $72. There appears to be a consistent trend of investors taking profits when the price hits approximately 3/4 of a clear target. Given this, if we set a bullish target for NVDA at $1,000, we can anticipate a potential price ceiling in the vicinity of $720, where significant resistance may be encountered. For those seeking to mitigate risk, considering an exit at around $680 could be a prudent strategy. This price corresponds to a market capitalization of $1.68 trillion and a P/E ratio of 355.5. While this is an ambitious target, it's not beyond the realms of possibility given the current rally.

&#x200B;

**Realistic Scenario:**

Based on our analysis of Fibonacci Retracement levels and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio trends, we consider NVDA reaching $480 as the most probable outcome. This represents a potential 23% increase from the current price level. In this scenario, NVDA would have a P/E ratio of 251.31, indicating a market capitalization of approximately $1.18 trillion. This could be an opportune moment to sell, locking in gains before any potential market correction.

While it's also interesting to note that at a P/E ratio of 300, while high, is not unheard of for high-growth tech stocks. This would place NVDA's market cap at around $1.4 trillion and the stock price at approximately $573, which is in line with Fibonacci extension. Given NVDA's strong fundamentals and growth prospects, we believe this could be the upper bounds of realistic outcome.

In conclusion, while trading high volatility stocks with meme stock momentum can be very risky, and has no fundamental backing at this point. It comes down to emotional control and resilience. We believe that a thorough understanding of NVDA's technical and fundamental indicators can guide investment decisions. Please keep in mind that investing involves risk and it is important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

&#x200B;

It's crucial to remain cool-headed and resilient. Knowledge is power, so understand the technical and fundamental indicators to guide your investment decisions. Remember, trading involves risk - don't go all-in without doing your homework and consulting with a professional advisor. Happy trading!",2023-05-29

NVDA did not file a new shelf offering.,2023-05-28
"No open positions in NVDA, but follow it. I’m seeing a misunderstanding run wild and thought I’d make a post to address it: NVIDIA on Friday did not file for NEW shelf offering. They filed an amendment to the one from February (the difference being dilution of 20 billion vs 10 billion). Further, the quarterly report explicitly addressed that this filing was coming purely for administrative purposes and that they actually have no plans to use it anytime soon (ie no dilution at all anytime soon).

The bear narrative that the rug has been pulled isn’t correct and everything can be understood by reading the quarterly report.

As mentioned in previous post, this is not financial advice, I currently do not have short or long positions in NVDA besides exposure in index funds. However, I was burnt by trusting NVDA in the past as a shareholder; they were charged by SEC last year because of it: https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-79",2023-05-28

"If you ever feel bad, remember that Cathie Wood dumped NVDA in early January when it was in the $140s",2023-05-25
" (Bloomberg) -- **Cathie Wood’s flagship exchange-traded fund closed out  its Nvidia Corp. stake in early January**. Then, came the artificial  intelligence frenzy that sent the stock and its big tech peers on a  tear.

The chipmaker has added around $560 billion in market  capitalization since Wood dumped her shares — with the last $200 billion  of that surge coming overnight after the company handily beat earnings.

Although  Wood holds Nvidia across several of her smaller funds, investors in the  flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) have mostly been left out of  this year’s blistering 161.58% rally.

**In February, when Nvidia traded for $234 a share, roughly 50 times forward earnings, Wood said the valuation was “very high.”**

“We  like Nvidia, we think it’s going to be a good stock. It’s priced —it’s  the ‘check-the-box’ AI company,” Wood told CNBC on Feb 27. “For a  flagship fund, where we’ve consolidated towards our highest conviction  names, part of that has to do with valuation.”

A spokesperson for ARK Investment Management said the company doesn’t comment on trading activity. 

Wood has been a long-time fan of Nvidia, but her conviction on the stock has wavered at times.

"Many of you were asking for me to post an update on my $NVDA weekly call option profits. Today I sold near open. Could've made about 20k more if timed it perfectly but I have no regrets, I am very happy!! 

I made around 181k (in USD) in profits, and this account went from 38k to around 219k (in USD)

I am now DCA into dividend stocks over the next few weeks, mixed in with some ""growth"" stocks mixed in that still pay a little dividend. Some of you were asking which dividend stocks I plan to buy, and this is not financial advice and DYOR but they include: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA (very small opening position at this price), JPM, SBUX, KO, PG, and O.

Of these, at today's (May 25, 2023) prices, my fav starting price positions are for SBUX and O (think these are good price for these 2 stocks especially). Again, not financial advice.

Happy to collect dividends from this portfolio going forward!

"I’m back from bank crisis with 80k loss. Now, this time’s different. $NVDA",2023-05-24
"NVDA may hold promise for the future, but its current Price to Earnings (PE) and Price to Sales (PS) ratios are less than impressive. Earnings appear stagnant, with PC gaming in decline. The majority of their profit is derived from data services, rather than Al.

Moreover, we're grappling with the debt ceiling limit. When analyzing patterns from past 'blood weeks', history shows NVDA experienced a 30% drop during such events. The economic outlook is not favorable and there's a downward trend, as evidenced by the overvaluation of PPD. Despite being hyped and exceeding $100 due to strong buying pressure for a significant period, it now faces a 40% reduction.

Add to that the ongoing uncertainty around the China trade war, and you have a multitude of reasons contributing to a potential decrease in the stock's value.

Disclosure: I hold over 17k short positions in NVDA. My investment track record is far from flawless - I lost approximately 80k last March and, to date, Fidelity has yet to retrieve my funds. So, my struggles in the market are evident. Let's proceed.",2023-05-24

Trading volume was too low to sustain NVDA’s after hours price action.,2023-05-25
"

Listen folks, there was not enough trade volume to trust the current price of NVDA. It looks like there were a bunch of people buying, and no one selling and that pumped the price due to artificial scarcity. When the profit taking begins, the share price will fall rapidly. It will probably hold on to most of its gains as there will also be more buyers and not just more sellers in a higher volume environment.

If you won your NVDA, it will be a max dash to take your profits tomorrow morning. I suggest liquidating during pre market.

All y’all with huge unrealized gains on your options, hopefully you’re still ITM after pre market price action. Expect huge slippage when you’re selling your calls if you’re not deep ITM when options trading resumes. 


What happens after the pre market and opening sell off? FOMO dip buyers, scalpers, and passive funds rebalancing will help stem the losses to a degree. Or, the market will see a falling knife and steer clear.

Did y’all NVDA bulls get the chance to sell your calls today?,2023-05-26
"I have a question, I really didn’t see any huge Bid size on multiple brokerages for calls. Like some were 5-30 contracts. The bigger sizes were the closer to $300-$330 but even those weren’t heavily volumed. Was all of them closed at open like really quick. But I checked literally at open, no way thousands of contracts were all sold at open. 

Please someone explain cause I have seen stocks go up yet calls didn’t sell cause there was no bidding.",2023-05-26

"NVDA has been a hot topic in WallstreetsBets for a long time. Seems like all the bears have been getting squeezed to absolute nothingness. After seeing it rally another 20% after earnings today one has to ask themselves, is it time to short the chip manufacturing giant NVDA. With a whopping 750B Market cap is it really worth the price we see on our brokerages. 
If you ask me I’d say maybe it’s time to take some profits and flip a little bit bearish but who am I?",2023-05-24

"TLDR: me no like dollar store. me short dollar store company. also ai is the future. 

Here are some more-likely-true-than-not assumptions:

1. AI is the future. because AI duh. 
2. Dollar stores are not the future (who buys 6 eggs for $3 when you can buy a dozen for the same price 🫠)
3. i don’t like dollar stores. 

who am i to say these assumptions are correct in the first place? 🙃 nonetheless based on these assumptions DLTR is more worthy of shorting than NVDA/AMD/AAPL etc etc.

"The daily abandoned baby… 5-24-23 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ and VIX Daily Market Analysis (bonus NVDA earnings)",2023-05-24
"Well going into today I actually found myself to be fairly bullish and I truly expected a bounce and for us to close much higher than we closed yesterday. However, that clearly did not happen and clearly was wrong to be a bull up here. 

Looking at SPY and QQQ daily here it would appear that I was a day early… With SPY and QQQ closing out there abandoned baby daily bullish reversal candles honestly the temptation to swing calls is insanely high… However, I actually back tested my swing trades dating back to early 2022 and I actually am net negative on swings alone… so as much as they are enticing… not worth it to me. 

Now for those of you that don’t know what the abandoned baby pattern is… it’s a rarity and doesn’t always play out but when it does it usually results in a pretty massive move up… May 4th is the best example of that daily pattern. 

**NVDA EARNINGS**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gn6c5tki1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c988280ee606e64ccaea21edca431ebff1ce1ecd

There is literally nothing else that I can describe this market right now then “WOW.” I Just can not imagine the fact that a company with a PE near 200 can rally almost 27% on earnings and be near the ATHs… that truly is mindboggling. 

This market reminds me a lot of the spring of 2021… 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmxx7f3j1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d3d5cef6baa1526e4ff58e48976169e2ee9afe3

Now from a supply and demand stand point we didn’t do anything different today. The most intriguing thing is the fact that we actually gapped under the 413.05 supply. So generally speaking to have a previous supply taken out you must close a new supply over it and then you must touch that level with price action… a gap down completely changes that metric. So for now that 413.05 level remains on the books. 

We did come down and test 410.2 demand (Support) and hold that nicely today. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema for the first time since May 4th. 

Honestly, I can no help but notice the similarities of todays candle to May 4ths daily candle. If that is the case we likely could see a green open tomorrow and green day tomorrow. This would give us an opportunity to turn 411.16 into a new higher demand. 

However, IF bears can continue this momentum lower then more likely than not our target is daily demand (support) at 404.32/ 405.12. The daily DMI has officially reset to over sold but has not started its wave up. So we are in the early stages of finding the next bottom…. However, keep in mind that the DMI can remain oversold for a period of time before it retraces. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j6yl9mjj1v1b1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=853a6d1a3e9b1c57946198621ba7d12481cc656e

On the Daily we clearly broke through support of the red and black rising wedge. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema. However, we once again are finding support at the daily 50ema. 

We will keep an eye on this blue bear channel with resistance at 415.2 for tomorrow. In all honestly it appears that I was just one day too early on the bull rally… with NVDA this very well is the dip buy opportunity before we push hard to the 420-430 area again. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 413 -> 418.8  
 Demand- 410.2 -> 405.1  
 Support- 411.1 -> 410.2 -> 408.9  
 Resistance- 412.5 -> 414.1 -> 417.1

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j8i3gjzj1v1b1.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=85f45cb78bb1d821682107696293d75addffaa43

Futures came down and took out that 4149 supply that they had fell just short of yesterday. With this log wicked doji I do expect some upside tomorrow. However, the one interesting thing here is that right now this new daily candle has still not tried to put a new demand (support) in… DMI remainds oversold though so favor would be a short term bounce coming soon. 

If we get a green day and green bounce on futures tomorrow with a closure over 4165 then we should try to turn 4145 into a new demand (Support). 

However, if we fall through 4127 demand tomorrow then our target would be 4075 demand. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/baah8wek1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2ad7f1bed271fc0ccc759cf47cd131db00f55f13

Same story here on futes is that we did push a daily candle through the red and black daily rising wedge and now we find ourselves looking at this blue resistance line and that 4159 will be a major resistance to watch that futures actually is hard rejecting after hours here. 

If this is a back test and rejection of the daily 8ema on futures this could be a very bearish movement with the ultimate target being 4095 support. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4055 -> 4208  
 Demand- 4128 -> 4075  
 Support- 4125 -> 4110 -> 4095   
 Resistance- 4159 -> 4171 -> 4190 -> 4208

**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7e0td00l1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=beb3e112d1b7c7d461bb36df8a515ce6f4ce7c98

QQQ did close the same bullish abandoned baby pattern here as SPY… QQQ missed its intraday gap fill by about 9 cents. 

The daily 20ema will sit just over that 326.82 supply tomorrow and if the bears can continue to sell the markets off (which will be very hard to see QQQ drop with NVDA up 28%) then we should target that 326.82 supply. Looking here you can see we have a major demand (support) are at 325/326 and that should be a big area where we could bounce If we do see a continuation sell off. 

However, if we get a green day tomorrow we likely will see the DMI wave back up with a new demand being established at 331.32. This would lead QQQ to target 336.37 demand. I actually will look to take some longer 14-30dte calls on QQQ if we do see that play out tomorrow. 

QQQ Daily Levels  
 Supply- 337.6 -> 326.82 -> 322.31  
 Demand- 336.37 -> 325.99 -> 34.99

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vk3faoel1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9c668e1bcc92d6f4bedd9ecc35986f1df6a5c257

One reason I am also particularly bullish is the fact that the VIX attempted to break out over that critical 20.08 level and rejected. This rejection is a near perfect double top off the May 4th VIX candle which is when SPY put its bottom in… 

If the VIX retraces tomorrow and closes under 20.08 again then I would feel far more confident that we are going to see a bigger upside move on SPY…

The next major upside level for the VIX is 21.36 and downside level is 18.86. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xqfco2tl1v1b1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=210f41cb75f825b2aee9bc8f65387188f8a65045

Honestly this was a terrible trading day just from a day trading stand point… 0dte premiums were so juiced because of Yellen and FOMC minutes and we had really such little overall movement that plays just weren’t paying out very well… I really did okay trading intraday and my day trades were green by my swing calls were obviously red and that gave me a good sized hole. 

Still working on a nice week of gains here but definitely not my best day of trading.",2023-05-24

I have an 82 percent win rate however I help 5 415 puts and 7 410 puts over night even tho you were bullish and I was to tbh something told me to only sell one of them. Today sold all of them for one of my best trading days. Turned around and bought 5 325 qqq calls and  7 415 spy calls and 2 350 nivida calls for Friday based on earnings could be a 10 bagger.

"I'm about to finish my second month of trading spy options and my first month of following here.  I am just barely green after two months with a couple of fantastic weeks and a disastrous start to May.  

My stake is between 1k and 1.5k

My weekly goals are between $300 and $500

I am generally making 2 trades per day.  

I have to say your write ups are very helpful.  I could use a bit of advice on finding entry and exit points, though.  I tend to be a bit behind on my entries and hold on a bit too long for exits.  I miss out on some movements and either lose gains or leave money on the table.  Any advice is appreciated

Thanks for all you do here",2023-05-25
"Cramer, NVDA and Algos",2023-05-25
"This are the tweets from Jim Cramer regarding NVDA today:

https://preview.redd.it/2zlog65kqx1b1.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e9b97454e3b5082742a8991da7ab0a5157f81e5a

The first one was made before the earnings data (1:38 PM PDT (California time)). NVDA earnings release was at 2:00 PM

In theory is a bullish tweet if you assume that he loves his dog. But algos (AI) may have interpreted it like ""NVDA is like a dog"" so it will ""underperform"".

Maybe that sparked a signal on the algos and they started to bid NVDA shares helping to drive it to ATHs (I bet advanced algos support the inverseCramer signal)

Some hours later Cramer started tweeting clearly unambiguous bullish tweets about NVDA. The thing is that he tweeted those after trading was closed. After hours trading ends at 8:00 PM ET (which is 5:00 PM PDT) and he did that tweet at 5:13 PM PDT

Wow! Will the Algos reverse and sell tomorrow?

It will be interesting to see what happens",2023-05-25

"Unleashing the Hybrid Cloud AI Revolution: Nvidia's DGX, IBM's Ansible, and the Perfect Storm",2023-05-30
"Not financial advice!

Nvidia's recent product announcements may provide valuable clues about the future of AI and which companies are best positioned for the value AI will unlock. I'm not personally interested in buying  NVDA at current prices, as its price seems to be close to at least somewhat re-rated to market expectations.  We're early in the game here de-gens and there might be other opportunities worth exploring that are flying under the radar.  It' this regard’s opinion that reading between the lines of Nvidia's new product roadmap, can uncover potential AI benefits that haven't yet been fully reflected in the stock prices of other companies.

So… Nvidia has dropped a big one with its new DGX AI platform. If you're into the tech scene, you know Nvidia is a man amongst boys in the AI space. This DGX thing? It's a beast. Imagine a supercharged AI playground, but it's not just playing around - it's working, and working damn hard.

It's gonna be huge for our cloud bros - Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Google Cloud, IBM, all of 'em. They'll be drooling all over this DGX platform. Why? It's like an AI power-up. Whoever taps into this beast will have their AI game leveled up big time.

But here's where the fun starts. This DGX tech isn't just good for any cloud - it's perfect for the hybrid cloud approach. That's where you mix up your on-premises servers (that's tech talk for the old-school, actual physical stuff) with public cloud services. This hybrid stuff is a big deal for AI because it gives you flexibility, security, and the raw horsepower you need to run high-powered AI applications. And guess who's the hybrid cloud champ? It's our old friend IBM, who's been pushing the hybrid cloud way harder than anyone else.

And how does IBM do it? Enter Ansible. This thing is like the magic wand for setting up and managing hybrid cloud stuff. It's a massive hit with the tech geeks because it's like a cheat code for making complex stuff simple. Ansible lets you stand up new hybrid cloud AI products and services like you're flipping pancakes.

Now, Ansible's part of IBM's tool kit, thanks to their acquisition of Red Hat a while back. IBM + Ansible + hybrid cloud is like the dream team for leveraging Nvidia's DGX platform. While all the cloud providers are gonna want a piece of the DGX pie, IBM is sitting pretty with their hybrid cloud focus and their Ansible magic.

Bottom line: Nvidia's DGX platform is throwing down the gauntlet in the AI game, and it's shouting ""hybrid cloud or bust!"" IBM's sitting in the sweet spot with Ansible and their hybrid cloud game.

IBM’s share value has been mostly stagnant over the past few months.  No AI respect!  No AI respect here at all I tell ya!  When the next year or two’s quarterly numbers come in, the markets will have to take notice.  JMO",2023-05-30

Weekly Expected Moves! Frothy Markets,2023-05-30
"[https://i.postimg.cc/kG3YpBVS/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/kG3YpBVS/image.png)

 

Use these like any indicator, with caution. Basically gives you an understanding of when we start going into oversold or overbought territories.

1. This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers.
2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves. Obviously, if there are unexpected poison pills in an earnings report or if there are unexpected positive catalysts, you can move outside the deviations.
3. it's expected that 70% of the time we fall within the range by the end of the week/month/quarter. So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair it together with another tool called RSI. Most people are familiar with RSI. If we break out of the upper expected moves on already high RSI, this can create favorable short setups where you do have probabilities on your side. Now keep in mind point 1 & 2 that I made. You can have overbought + high RSI on individual tickers like MSFT and NVDA because of something that may fundamentally change the company like a new revenue stream. Hence why this is more useful on index-related products.
4. At the end of the day, this is all a game of probability. When you are oversold on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the upside. When you are overbought on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the downside.",2023-05-30

Expected moves for this week (including NVDA) + notes on technicals. ENjoy~,2023-05-21

Use these like any indicator, with caution. Basically gives you an understanding of when we start going into oversold or overbought territories.

1. This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers.
2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves. Obviously, if there are unexpected poison pills in an earnings report or if there are unexpected positive catalysts, you can move outside the deviations.
3. it's expected that 70% of the time we fall within the range by the end of the week/month/quarter. So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair it together with another tool called RSI. Most people are familiar with RSI. If we break out of the upper expected moves on already high RSI, this can create favorable short setups where you do have probabilities on your side. Now keep in mind point 1 & 2 that I made. You can have overbought + high RSI on individual tickers like MSFT and NVDA because of something that may fundamentally change the company like a new revenue stream. Hence why this is more useful on index-related products.
4. At the end of the day, this is all a game of probability. When you are oversold on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the upside. When you are overbought on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the downside.",2023-05-21

"Held INTC a long time and it didn’t do anything.  In 2016 I decided to trim 1/2 off and diversify into another chip.  Figured NVDA would be a good choice as they were pretty much a gaming graphics play back then.

A little luck apparently never hurts.  The position now dwarfs my account.

I don’t play the options game like most here and typically go long stock only, and hold it a long time.  Boring, but effective on occasion.",2023-05-25

Holy fuck bro. That average cost is the lowest I’ve seen on Reddit,2023-05-25
So what's your strategies for next week on debt ceiling and NVDA earnings?,2023-05-20
"I am going in with a bunch of baggy puts 30 320 QQQ (You can guess when I bought these LOL), 10 330 QQQ puts, and 20 410 SPY puts and 10 SPY call 5/26 425. I'm thinking markets will be volatile and hope that my puts will eventually print... But, most likely calls will do better. All spy positions are 26 and QQQ's are on 23rd.

For NVDA I was planning to open a call position closer to the day of earnings, because I suspect markets to be swinging back and forth. But, now I'm conflicted, cause I was just bored and looking at some news on CNBC for fun. And came upon this... So yea now Idk I actually kind of agree with Cramer and I know I should inverse myself/Cramer, but this AI hype train is just too FOMO/YOLO/STRONK energy .

Op has a point. TSMC make all of Nvidia's chips. No TSMC no Nvidia GPUs. They can change fabs ofc but it does put the valuation into perspective. Not many fabs can rival TSMCs process and that's a big part of what has been fueling the energy efficiency of the latest generations of GPUs.,2023-05-19

That's it. That's all you need, one giant picture and a stock recommendation. But if you want a little bit more here ya go.   


  


[Haha, dum bers](https://preview.redd.it/27oqvqb4e52b1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c5275a5ee98788e38d1598bdb7f1903be6e4155e)

 

You fucking monkeys don't know shit. You're all too scared of your god damned shadows because this world has eaten you up and spit you out. You got one fucking win on Shitadel two years ago and you've been mowed down trying to relive that glory. You all remind me of those fucking apes in 2001 too afraid to step forward and transcend by touching the monolith  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHWs3c3YNs4 . But this ape, /u/ShittyStockPicker ain't afraid to take a fucking risk. 

I’ve been hearing about the impending recession since covid started, I’ve been hearing about the collapse of the dollar since 1990. The internet is full of bears who want to see America punished for its imagined sins: greed, debt, laziness. Why, if you listened to those fucking bears who hate this country and want to see it fail you'd think America was two Oompa Loompas away from being sung a demeaning song about why it fucked up and dragged off the world stage.   
But I'm not one of those America haters. I'm like Warren Buffet, I never fucking bet against America. Ever. 

The hard pill for America haters to swallow is that we are the best god damned system on the planet bar none. The culture we have built worships talent and those stupid enough to risk everything for a dream.  And we don't give a flying fuck if you're a queer dragon-kintyped non-binary star planet. If you're stupid enough to try the impossible, we're going to fucking cheer you on. And when you achieve the impossible, we're going to fucking reward you with it by both worshiping you as a fucking god and more wealth than you know what to do with.   


It's not that way in any other system. You won't find that in Europe, you're not going to find it in India. Don't even think about trying to find that in China.   
If you have a fucking crazy, insane longshot idea that just might fucking work the only people stupid enough to try live here. And its because if you're not descended from people who were told by their countrymen, ""Hey, Gus, just shut the fuck up about going to the moon already and eat your fucking gruel."" You said, ""fuck it, I'm going to America and studying engineering until I can build the biggest ass ladder I can possibly build!""   
And that's still the America I believe in. And I believe that's the America /r/WallStreetBets believes in.   
So is it any fucking surprise then, that once again the United States is at the forefront of yet another technological revolution that is going to profoundly transform global society, rearrange international power structures, and change everything? 

I've been struggling to explain what AI means to people. But here's my best shot, dumb fucks probably want to skip to the end for the TLDR: ***The Information Technology boom introduced sharing of information at 0 marginal cost. The AI boom is different from the Information Technology boom because it is the beginning of the generation of new information at 0 marginal cost.***   
***Information Age: Sharing information at 0 marginal cost***  

***AI Age: Generation of new information at 0 marginal cost***  

Let that fucking sink in. *Generation of information at 0 marginal cost from newspapers to rocket designs.*  

I don't know if you had the chance to listen to the $NVDA conference call, but holy shit I fucking creamed myself rubbing my dick to it. There's nothing that gets me off harder than Capitalism Erotica. 

What the $NVDA call revealed is that corporate America is scrambling to build systems that utilize AI to keep their businesses competitive. There is no reluctance to adopt AI the same way there was reluctance to adopt IT technology 20 years ago. That's going to make adoption of AI happen fucking fast!

Many current CEO's remember companies going bust, or losing market share to a rival who was faster to adopt groundbreaking technology. *The lesson they learned was that it is deadly to shrug off changes in technology.*

The first wave of the AI boom is in stocks like $NVDA. Demand for their chips is going to be insane. The next wave, we'll see this show up in six to twelve months or so, is going to be the companies who adopted AI early and found obvious and unexpected ways to take advantage of 0 marginal cost information generation. ***The moment a company who adopted AI reports that an AI technology led to a blowout quarter we're going to see an explosion in stock prices and unimaginable GDP growth.*** 

We’re not going into recession, we’re on the brink of pushing the world into an unprecedented era of GDP growth and exponential growth in the rate of improvement of living standards.

We’re months away from new all time highs on the Nasdaq. The American economy is about to rip the world’s face off with a GDP rally the likes of which the world had never seen. 

TLDR: HAHAHAHAHA BERSSSSS R FUKKKKKKKK

[Account #3. Maxed out my credit card, line of credit, and took some money from account #1 to put here.](https://preview.redd.it/at30q8147x1b1.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=968f768cc4f72f9aeb0f846592914e2445b5aed9)

Almost all of my losses came from being \~max margin short $NVDA during earnings (last earnings, not this one), and being \~max margin long during $ASTS earnings.

I've coped with these losses decently well I would like to think. I'm still up a ton from where I started (\~70k), but it kind of sucks not being a millionaire anymore. I used to pay the bill every time my friends and I would go out to eat, tip big, get haircuts often, eat out every single meal of the day (and be able to afford extra meat lol), etc. I don't feel secure doing that right now. It felt really good not having to worry about money.

The worst out of all this is that I promised my parents I would buy them a house, and I can no longer do that. Houses are 1.5m+ in my area, and at one point I could have literally bought it in cash. Instead, I gambled it all away. They were dejected but I can't go back to the past and change what happened. They'll have to live in a shitty apartment unfortunately until I can figure things out again.  

Let's look at the bright side (coping mechanism😔):

1. I made these mistakes at 22. I still have time to recover from losses (hopefully)
2. I already took out and spent \~150k buying my parent's cars, paying off their debts, and spending money on myself before I lost most the money
3. I haven't lost everything. Almost everything, but not everything.
4. I couldn't sleep at night with my extremely leveraged portfolio. I feel as if a weight has been taken off my back.
5. I am still alive, and healthy. We don't need much money nowadays to get our basic needs met. We don't need much money to be happy.

At the end of the day, I'm still thankful for everything I've been blessed with. I have clean water, food on the table, and a roof over my head. Sure, you need to strive and work towards greater heights, but you still need to appreciate what you have.

Lessons/Mistakes:

1. We underestimate tail risks (even if you know that you underestimate tail risks), and we underestimate how losses (and wins) can trigger a feedback loop of possibly portfolio-ending decisions (I literally wrote this on my last post before I lost my money, but I ended up losing it anyways😓)
2. The market is not rational. It doesn't care about your squiggly (or straight) lines or your discounted cash flow analysis (at least right away). Position yourself accordingly.
3. Have other things to do other than watching the market. I was researching/watching the market 10 hours+ a day some days. I stopped going to the gym. I stopped going to my classes. Etc. Just to watch the market and find some sort of alpha online. Being too active made me consistently switch my positions up, and made me unable to sit on my hands.
4. Position sizing. I would go all in on a single stock a lot of the time. Using margin as well.
5. Using margin. I was using maximum margin ever since I started investing/trading. I'm surprised I didn't get wiped a whole lot earlier. When you use max margin, you are forced to sell at the worst prices, and volatility drag occurs.
6. Shorting on max margin. This was pretty fking regarded, but it's what made me most of my money. When you short, you can only make a maximum of 100% but your risks are unlimited. Not an asymmetrical bet you'd want to take often imo.
7. Next time around, if I do ""short"", I would need to either do it using puts or be short stock with calls as hedges.
8. All or nothing mentality. Even when I already made it. This was pretty regarded as well. I could have gone all in on dividend stocks and never had to work a day in my life. But I didn't do that.
9. Probs a million other things

Don't really have much more to say, but take care of yourselves bros. Start hitting the gym. Talk to that girl (even if she makes you nervous). Make more money. Fix/strengthen your relationship with your friends and family. Find God. Find yourself a waifu (not Mikasa because she's taken). You get the point.

How a Debt-Ceiling Crisis Could Screw Up Wall Street 📉,2023-05-26
"Here are what you regards should know about the current debt-ceiling situation. \[Source\]([https://www.wsj.com/articles/debt-ceiling-crisis-wall-street-acc4b5a7](https://www.wsj.com/articles/debt-ceiling-crisis-wall-street-acc4b5a7))   


💸 The US government is getting dangerously close to not being able to pay its damn bills on time, and that's bad news for Wall Street and the global financial system.

📉 If the US government defaults on its Treasury bonds, it could totally screw up the multi-trillion dollar markets that keep everything running smoothly.

💪 The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Sifma) has been busting its ass for over a decade, trying to come up with a plan to avoid a catastrophic blow to the financial markets like we saw back in 2011.

🤔 So, what's gonna happen if Congress doesn't raise the debt limit in time? Well, Sifma says the Treasury might have to delay repaying bondholders and screw with their interest payments. And that's gonna piss off a lot of investors.

🤷‍♂️ You've got money-market funds, banks, and companies all investing in Treasurys to manage their cash. Plus, tons of regular folks have been buying up government debt, especially short-term T-bills. But if a deal isn't reached, those poor suckers might not get their money back for who knows how long!

📅 Sifma expects the Treasury to take it day by day, announcing plans to extend the life of bonds that are supposed to mature on the day before. It's all about keeping the show going, you know?

💥 But here's the thing, if the Treasury messes up and a bond matures without getting paid, it's gonna cause chaos in the Fedwire system. That could freeze billions of dollars in assets overnight and seriously make people question if the US government has any credibility left.

🤯 This debt-ceiling mess could have all sorts of crazy consequences. It might trigger a full-blown financial crisis and who knows what else. The SEC chair is warning that those hedge fund guys have been borrowing like crazy in the Treasury market, and that's a risk to all of us regular folks.

⚠️ Remember back in 2011 when S&P downgraded the US credit rating? Well, analysts are worried that more downgrades could happen, and that would seriously shake confidence in the US government. Wall Street would feel the pain, and the government and taxpayers might end up paying more in interest.

💰 The US Treasury's cash on hand isn't looking too great. They've got an account at the Fed called the Treasury General Account, but it's almost $900 billion lighter than last year. Not a good sign.

📉 This debt-ceiling crap is already messing with the bond market. The Treasury has been issuing fewer short-term Treasury bills, which screwed up trading and caused crazy fluctuations in rates. People are flocking to safe assets like Treasurys, expecting them to rally big time.

 Wall Street and the global financial system are on the edge of a freaking cliff.  Ditched my NVDA and AMD holdings on Thursday and made some sweet tendies. It's time to GTFO before this shit show gets real. You better do the same, my fellow degenerates! 💸🚀",2023-05-26

Is there potential to short NVDA?,2023-05-19
"
I was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. 

I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.

I do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.

Seems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts seems legitimate. What do you guys think?",2023-05-19

>TL;DR: NVDA is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year.

"This was a brutal day to trade. This felt like a few weeks ago where all the technicals were completely detached. Very tough trading today and honestly the fact that I basically broke even (slightly red day) is impressive as I felt like this was a big L of a day. 

This also reminded me of late 2022 where I would enter a position and almost immediately be down 5-10%... I haven’t seen that happen in a long time. IT was very weird and there were so many times I felt like premiums didn’t make any sense compared to the actual underlying. Frustrating day but a good reminder that we exploit the days that fit our strategy and we just survive the days that don’t without suffering major losses. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6z8le3psq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7680f4c2f65344ac291f0ebbf6131825af65ce68

As of right now surprisingly we did not establish a new demand today… we came very close (had we closed over 415 we would have)… so this means 1 of 2 things… first, this means that this was a fake breakout and that we tomorrow will see a massive rejection tomorrow to close at 410.2 or below… OR it means tomorrow we establish a new demand (Support) and we bounce. 

Now when we look at other things like the DMI which did start a wave up (bullish) and momentum still being bullish (not extreme) one would favor a breakout tomorrow to put a new demand in. However, this is anyones game for tomorrow right now. 

From a weekly supply/ demand stand point we are as of now set to make a new 418.59 supply and take out 416.08 supply. We also are holding the support of the 411.46 demand. 

The ideal bear close tomorrow is under 411.46 and the ideal bull close is over 416.08. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h2ge4o7tq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a311c28180c7002eec379a170a17acc732a95218

Price action wise we did manage to come back up and retake the daily 8ema resistance. The one interesting thing is that we closed a doji. Now this could mean that we reject and push lower tomorrow (would think more of an evening doji star pattern). 

From a price action start point bulls would prefer a close minimally over 417 and bears would prefer a close under 412.4.

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 418.78 -> 419.5  
 Demand- 410.2  
 Support- 414.6 -> 412.4 -> 411   
 Resistance- 417 -> 418.6

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9dje99ntq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4231c8854754e7512c41c0983c132a2faa5b4657

From a supply and demand stand point futures also did not put in a new demand here… however, we may see that happen if that moves up overnight. However, we would certainly need a daily close over the 4160 area in order to establish a new one. 

If we do put a new one in our upside target would be 4198. However, if this was a failed breakout/ recovery then our target would be 4127 again tomorrow and eventually 4075. 

From a weekly stand point we are set to put a new supply in at 4200 to take our 4192 supply. We are still bouncing off 4130 demand too. Bears want a close under 4130 and bulls want a closure over 4200. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5wtuyn1uq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9cf8e4946912109fdc651a74db695e51f5b489a7

On futures bulls failed to retake the daily 8ema here but did retake the daily 20ema. With a downside to upside doji this actually to me looks more bearish in nature and could see us with a sell off overnight and into tomorrow. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that we are going into a 3 day weekend and I believe with no debt ceiling being signed today that they will not be meeting until Tuesday. That could cause markets to want to sell off and be risk off into the long 3 day weekend (friendly reminder markets are closed Monday!).

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4216 -> 4209 -> 4055  
 Demand- 4198 -> 4128  
 Support- 4158 -> 4126 -> 4110  
 Resistance- 4172 -> 4188 -> 4208

**QQQ SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u8gy0jjuq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47dff0613041517124523b2b600c330de0397be3

Now this is where QQQ completely differs from SPY… here you can see we did indeed close out a bullish abandoned baby reversal… in doing so we put in a new 331.35 demand and now we are pushing upwards. 

The one interesting thing here is that we actually in gapping up like this are now seeing a possible bearish abandoned bearish reversal formed too… The daily DMI is waving up which gives further upside favor but if we got a hard rejection or drop tomorrow we actually likely will turn 339.72 into a new supply (resistance) and would look to retest 337.6 and possibly even 331.35 again. 

From a weekly stand point the DMI is very overbought here and we have still not put a new weekly supply in. We have our next major level at 361.85. Bulls would like a closure anywhere over 335-340 and bear ideally need a closure under 330. 

QQQ Daily Levels  
 Supply- 347.11 -> 337.6 -> 326.82  
 Demand- 336.37 -> 331.35 -> 325.99

**VIX** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e7hbrq5vq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3de28101d61d7ad29bd02af4019de508804ae47c

As I was suspecting the VIX did reject. I was thinking that closure under 20.08 would lead to a downside move on VIX and would also lead to an upside move on SPY. Now one thing here to keep in mind is that 18.86 is a strong support area followed by 17.97. If SPY bears can bounce us off 18.86 tomorrow again then we could look to close over 20.08 to end the week and head into a 3 day weekend. In doing so could see the doji rejection play out here on spy daily. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qx3vo5jvq12b1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=88585d6e1ee3a7a1bde23f23cecdeff855b7a3fc

Honestly the fact that I closed just barely red today blows my mind as I truly felt like the whole day was a massive L. I have some pretty solid concrete rules for entries and exits. Today I just could not find a good entry to save my life. Today was definitely the type of day that if you wait for confirmation you already were too late and bought the top or bottom. There was also the lovely morning where SPY price action completely inversed what VOLD was doing. Honestly my thoughts on a day like today is that when big cap like NVDA is up 25-30% that the internals go completely wack and we are just left with poor technicals to trade. When you step back at the EOD it clearly was a range day today, however, it was not like our usual range days with clear set techncials for entries. 

I also a lot of times found as soon as I entered into a position that the premium almost seemed lagged and would instantly hit me 5-7%... there was a lot of times too where there seemed almost like a 3-5 second delay on price action versus premium. I watched a few solid candle drops on SPY and the put I had qued didn’t move at all and then all of a sudden it would be a $2 pump on premium. 

Tough day to trade but I look forward to a better day tomorrow.",2023-05-25

DD: NVDA to $700 by this time next year,2023-05-18
"**The A100 is the current market leader for AI tasks at $10,000-$18,000 per card. Its purchased by every major cloud vendor.**

https://preview.redd.it/m0d8s7zbpn0b1.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4744071f5ed7ca45f9886a5d4e00385e783d951a

[https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/)

**The A100 is the market leader because it has ASIC cores that accelerate the major ML libraries such as pytorch and tensorflow. Other vendors are years behind nvidia.**

* The market for HPC AI cards is currently $10B. Overall HPC market is $35B. Market projections are 20%-40% growth in AI HPC buys over the next 5 years. In the worst case projection that market becomes $25B, best case is $54B. Add in all HPC buys, and the projection for 2028 sits around $50B-$80B.
* Nvidia's current revenue is $24B split into gaming, embedded, HPC, and other markets, so there is a good case for it tripling revenue in 5 years just based on AI growth.

https://preview.redd.it/be28h4tdpn0b1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5fb26a7deceb7f0952ef049a3d31471aa66c5299

* There is currently a chip surplus, so Nvidia revenue is down overall because of reduced demand in other markets, but this is projected to change
* However, AI chips use the latest node processes from fabs (predominantly TSMC for AI), which are much more supply constrained than the overall chip market. The overall chip market is predominantly older processes.
* The A100 is currently selling over MSRP because firms are madly trying to scoop them up. In fact it is backordered by a month and a half on all major public vendors.
* This means nvidia is losing at least a month and a half of AI HPC revenue this year already due to supply problems. If they were not supply constrained, revenue would beat last year.
* Long term, Nvidia can renegotiate fab contracts to outbid other chip designers. Apple outbid everyone for the latest TSMC 5nm node process for their M1 chips, but seeing as A100s are being sold by scalpers for almost double MSRP, Nvidia can change this in coming years.

This is the original reason NVDA is going up. **Are NVDA detractors right saying its overvalued now that it has gone up almost 200% from lows this year? Yes its overvalued based even on the generous projected revenue above.**

Then why is it continuing to go up? Other factors for why NVDA is going up:

* Market tailwind from tech stocks overall going up. This can account for 1/3 of NVDA's rise, and will continue to dramatically effect it.
* Index funds rebalancing. NVDA is on the Nasdaq-100 which is tracked by many mutual funds and etfs. These funds are buying NVDA to rebalance their market-cap weighted portfolios.
* The ""IT"" stock. Investors are craving another crazy stock to cash in on. They've seen a stock as dumb as a certain video game store go to the moon, so why not a company that actually has some fundamentals?

Why $700 next year:

* Nasdaq-100 will go up at least 30%. This gives a baseline of $400 for NVDA next year
* The AI gold rush won't stop for another three years. NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL are the only public stocks that are well positioned to benefit from AI. NVDA is the public company, as a proportion of its revenue, that will be affected the most. This makes it the best company to invest in if you believe AI is the next miracle (I don't). This will mean it will outperform the market. Lets say another 30% on top of the market or $500 by next year this time
* FOMO. All you regards who just want to make money will jump on the bandwagon. This will be around another 60% of today's value. All that together is 120%, and gives us $700.

**Proof I'm putting my money where my mouth is below. My plan is to hold for one year.**

"Every price target set has been or will be (e.g 350 this morning) hit. Not even Cramer being bullish has cause any harm to this behemoth. 
This is the first stock that analyst are perfect with.

Earnings next week are gonna send this to at least 325 regardless of the fact there is no justification for this company to be valued at 800 billion and have a net income of around 1.5 billion. But Ai will be said at least 25 times and every time it is said 1 dollar will be added. Google went with 64 times so I expect nvda to do at least one AI per 30 seconds.

Bears for the love of God stop shorting this, go burn your money in a pile at least then you get some heat as a return. Your yearly tax deduction is already good for 100 years and it is only May.",2023-05-18

Nvidia's AI Chip Boom and the Future of AI,2023-05-26
"🚀🚀🚀 Fellow astronauts, let's take a moment to appreciate the wonder that is Nvidia (NVDA), the powerhouse that's been soaring higher than a SpaceX Starship and shows no signs of slowing down. Let's look at some recent news and why we should keep our diamond hands ready.

Nvidia had an absolute barnburner of a year in 2023. The share price has more than doubled, with the company's market valuation hitting an astronomical $940bn (£760bn). After a fantastic early trading session that saw the share price rise by 25%, the stock topped out at $385.84 a share. Nvidia is riding the wave of AI demand, specifically for generative AI products like ChatGPT, which require massive data centers packed with their semiconductor chips.

Nvidia recently reported Q2 revenues of $7.2bn, smashing Wall Street's predictions by 10%. The company also made an ambitious forecast of $11bn in revenues for Q3, which is more than 50% higher than Wall Street's estimate of $7.2bn. Matt Bryson from Wedbush Securities said Nvidia ""absolutely blew away prior expectations”.

Mark Lipacis from Jefferies bank believes that Nvidia’s growing data centre revenues could even surpass the combined sales of central processing units from Intel and AMD, two of the stalwart chipmaker.

But it's not just about the numbers; it's about the future. Nvidia is at the forefront of AI, the big trend that everyone and their grandmother wants to get into. Companies are scrambling to integrate AI into their businesses, and that's a goldmine for Nvidia. They make the hardware needed to run the complex AI models, and they're ramping up their supply to meet the surging demand.

However, with all great opportunities come challenges. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has voiced concerns over trade restrictions that could cause ""enormous damage."" The geopolitics of the US and China are increasingly affecting chip companies, but Nvidia is still going strong.

In summary, Nvidia's booming business and its strategic position in the rapidly growing AI market make it a stock worth watching for all of us here at Wallstreetbets. Keep in mind that the rocket ride might have its bumps due to geopolitical factors, but as we know, that's all part of the journey to the moon.

P.S -this isn't financial advice. 🚀🚀🚀

P.P.S. - ""Stonks only go up"" is an investment strategy",2023-05-26

What to do with Stock Based Compensation?,2023-05-26
"Hey guys I was reading over some company filings as earnings season is in effect and I had an accounting question.

Free cash flow is typically found by just taking the operating cash flow and subtracting the general expenses (CAPEX) following all operation activity. However, stock based compensation gets included into operating cash flow activities and therefore adds to the free cash flow total.

This led me to wonder if I should subtract the stock based compensation from the total cash flow as stock based compensation is actually just a non-cash expense of the business and does dilute existing shareholders. This is shockingly significant however as many newer and mostly tech companies generate ridiculous amounts of there cash flow from stock based compensation which is extremely deceptive (ex. ADSK, TEAM, PLTR, NVDA, SNOW, CRM)

This led me to ask if it makes sense to subtract stock based compensation from cash flow , include it in cash flow, or something else.

What do you guys think?",2023-05-26

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-26.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean ""cheaper."" High numbers mean ""expensive."" A 1 means ""fairly"" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.
* **How should this be improved?** Do you have any suggestions or notice any bugs with this report?",2023-05-25

"Was heavily wrong with yesterdays gamble. Don’t care doubled down mid day. Down on the day ~7k. Think we still will be above 418 by Friday of this week. 

I don’t pay attention to after hours/pre market much as most of the time it’s BS so don’t fully trust the pump that NVDA has as of 4:45pm EST but we will see.

The reason I am currently playing like this is because I am currently up 28k on the month of may. These bets aren’t going to make or break my life. I do not recommend anyone follow my plays as I have been wrong countless times. Just my gut feeling with these plays. Start of each month play tighter and if up by the end go for the yolos.

Buying NVDA Puts,2023-05-17
"Rizzly & NVDA

Gather round the campfire returds, 
🪵 🔥 

Ye who would hear a tale of the market's ebb and flows, heed my words and listen well. For riches come and riches go, and with them tales of heaven and hell.

Once upon a time, in the land of Btfdville, there was a bold bear. He went by Rizzly, for it seemed the markets favored his every move. He believed he had charmed the capricious
mistress of fortune, gracefully doing the tango with she who is known as the cruel mistress herself. Word of his astute short-selling abilities spread like wildfire, and soon he was the talk of the town. What also gave him hella clout was his savage remarks regarding his stock market activities.

""The only thing sweeter than honey is shorting regional bank stocks to the ground"".
""Why is it that when stocks go DOWN, my PP go UP?""
“Idk whats falling harder, the bulls' dignity, your wife's panties, the Titanic or this stock I just shorted"".

Wherever he went , ""off colour"" remarks were expressed.

At the 5 star Michelin restaurant he could now afford going to, he told the waitress: I'll take a juicy bull steak and a stock that I can mercilessly crush into oblivion, thank you. And the drink? Shareholder tears, on the rocks plz"".
At the funeral of his aunt, Mama Bear: ""This stock l'm shorting is deader than her. It'll join my aunt, Harambe, and
 FRC in the afterlife shortly. Load up on puts, trust me bro"".
At his wedding to Burry: ""I take you as my beloved spouse, to have and to hold, and to mercilessly short stocks with, until profit do us part. As we embark on this bearish journey, let us unite our portfolios and short investment thesis"".

In Rizzley's hometown of Btfdville, most ppl were chill. Being a bull was the status quo while being a bear was a no go. Rizzley always felt that this was unfair, which is why the bulls' ego he wanted to tear. Rizzley, always a contrarian at heart, wanted to break their illusion apart. He prowled the investing landscape for the most robust stock, seeking the bulls' cherished gem among the flock. Lo and behold  Nvidia,bursting with buying pressure and bullish charisma. Rizzley found his target, and set about to make the stock bleed red like Target.
He wrote various DD's on WSB, spamming the post with meteor emojis ☄️☄️☄️. Rizzley put up his short thesis flyers in various places in Btfdville, the parks, stop signs, Wendy's, even on the traffic lights' red circle 🔴 . He married his brother to the Hindenburg Research CIO. He shared his rationale to various renowned publications of his town, such as the Grizzly Gazzete, Regarded Writings and Crayon Chronicles. He even released a book, ""The Bear's Den: Where Optimism Goes to Hibernate"". In it, he was quoted as saying ""bulls are like ostriches with their heads in the sand. They refuse to see the truth. All of this Al talk is hype lol. They'll learn soon enough, the hard way hopefully"".

Convinced NVIDIA would fall, and WSB's bearish echo chamber bolstering his appetite, he went all in on NDA puts.
He sold everything he had, including himself (worked extra shifts behind Wendy's dumpster). Believing this play wouldn't go tits up, he decided to hibernate. When he will wake up, he'd be richer than Jordan Belfort in 98’. After 69 days, he rose from his slumber, first thing he did is look at Lambos and was stuck on what color. After he ordered on uber his supper (salmon seasoned with bulls' crushed hopes and dreams, the more the better), he sat at his monitor and viewed his portfolio. To his utter
dismay, NVIDIA had made a ALL TIME HIGH TODAY (currently at $295.47). His portfolio was shredded , pain in his heart now embedded. His puts now nearly worthless, shattered the bear who was once fearless. He didn't know what to say, think, or do, only managed a GUH as ControltheNarrative did too.
He eventually regained some composure, and begged the market for this to be over. When he shouted ""THIS ISNT FAIR"", that’s his mans, Burry, walked in, ""Honey, your salmon
is here, seasoned perfectly to our liking, tonight, we shall feast like vikings.” With tears streaming down his face, Rizzly knew that he had just lost their place 🏡. The monitor, with one hand he tried to cover, and with the other halt his mate's enter. However, it was too late. Burry saw the look on Rizzly's face and [knew of their fate](https://ibb.co/xmXSZjc).

Alas, my fellow regards, he was never a bear, but an ostrich with too much flair.
And I, what positions do I hold? Why 30 NVIDIA 285p's of course, all told.

😏 TLDR: BUY NVDA PUTS ☄️☄️☄️",2023-05-17

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-26.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean ""cheaper."" High numbers mean ""expensive."" A 1 means ""fairly"" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.

Why doesn't NVDA have competition,2023-05-18
"This isn't really a pro/con article. Just wondering where the competition is.

The barriers of entry are certainly high. You need fabs, (or the ability to outsource it) but those are actually not that impossible to find. And even though it might take some time, there are dozens of foundries coming online in the next decade, which will help any newcomer ramp up. This is a great time to establish long-term contracts with manufacturers. Maybe even help INTC come back from utter failure. WTF happened to those cats? Remember when people didn't know if AMD would survive bankrupty because INTC was beating them senseless? Pepperidge Farm remembers.

I digress.

The reality is NVDAs greatest tool in their arsenal, that will be the main obstacle for any competitor, is their long-developed software library: numerous SDKs, CUDA, various other APIs and tools given freely to developers (even though they cost billions to develop), etc.

They use these free tools to ""help"" developers integrate WOW features into their game's way ahead of schedule (even if most people's machine/monitor can't even utilize it): DLSS, Ray Tracing, PHYSX, 3D Vision, TXAA, Lovelace, Gsync, and a bunch of other crap I can't remember.

Integrating these features into their SDKs creates a symbiotic (parasitic?) relationship where Game developers almost require consumers to own NVDA cards to have the best performance and visual quality - an ouroboros of features feeding technology - Stupidity no one needs. C'mon gang, $1500 for a video card? 

I digress, again.

These do not seem insurmountable obstacles. Sure, it will take a god-like amount of money. But there are literally 100s of billions of $ sitting in private accounts waiting to invest in something. In 2021 there were 1035 IPOS, 2022 gave us 181, and so far in 2023, a grand total of 65. I won't even discuss SPACS or Chinese nonsense stocks - smart money is over that shit.

VC & Angel investors are champing at the bit to invest in AI. And the only thing you have to show them are the margins. GG.

If this seems a hard sell - Recall a tale of a strange man who once told a bunch of billionaire investors (with a straight face) that he could simultaneously take on the car and oil industries. And he would do it by building electric cars. Electric cars that were fast and cool. All the investors had to go on was the abomination known as the GM EV1. And they gave him the $. This seems less daunting.

Sidenote: I would call the new company:  **AaEye**. Tagline: **We drank the Kool-(AI)D**",2023-05-18

Volume tickers in play,2023-05-24
"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.",2023-05-24

">To find the best tickers to trade, I recommend looking at volume and float. You can use this information to determine which stocks are moving and which ones are stagnant. Additionally, you should look at company financials to get an idea of their profitability and cash reserves.

NVDA Stock Ranked - Market Expectations vs. Current Earnings Reality,2023-05-16
"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t30neg7pl90b1.jpg?width=767&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4c3e60c94a7fac88f057960d700ddd3cdbfa2f6b

At NVDA's current closing stock price of $292.13, the market is saying that Nvidia is currently the #6 most valuable listed company in the world (by market cap)... yet there are 354 listed companies that have more net earnings than NVDA, and 431 listed companies that have more revenue than NVDA.

While I have no doubt that NVDA will climb up in the earnings and revenue rankings after future earnings reports, they still have a long LONG way to go to justify being the #6 most valuable company in the world by market cap.  Orders of magnitude of company growth expectations are now already baked into the stock price of NVDA.

&#x200B;

How does this happen?  How did we get here?

Answer:  ""AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI HYPE OmG ItS ThE FuTuRE BrO!!!""

Do I expect the stock price to correct any time soon?

Answer:  I have no clue.  I don't know how long this clown stock will continue to trade on AI hype, rather than valuation fundamentals.",2023-05-16

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-26.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean ""cheaper."" High numbers mean ""expensive."" A 1 means ""fairly"" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.

Volume tickers in play,2023-05-23
"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Rizzly & NVDA,2023-05-16
"Gather round the campfire returds, 
🪵 🔥 

Ye who would hear a tale of the market's ebb and flows, heed my words and listen well. For riches come and riches go, and with them tales of heaven and hell.

Once upon a time, in the land of Btfdville, there was a bold bear. He went by Rizzly, for it seemed the markets favored his every move. He believed he had charmed the capricious
mistress of fortune, gracefully doing the tango with she who is known as the cruel mistress herself. Word of his astute short-selling abilities spread like wildfire, and soon he was the talk of the town. What also gave him hella clout was his savage remarks regarding his stock market activities.

""The only thing sweeter than honey is shorting regional bank stocks to the ground"".
""Why is it that when stocks go DOWN, my PP go UP?""
“Idk whats falling harder, the bulls' dignity, your wife's panties, the Titanic or this stock I just shorted"".

Wherever he went , ""off colour"" remarks were expressed.

At the 5 star Michelin restaurant he could now afford going to, he told the waitress: I'll take a juicy bull steak and a stock that I can mercilessly crush into oblivion, thank you. And the drink? Shareholder tears, on the rocks plz"".
At the funeral of his aunt, Mama Bear: ""This stock l'm shorting is deader than her. It'll join my aunt, Harambe, and
 FRC in the afterlife shortly. Load up on puts, trust me bro"".
At his wedding to Burry: ""I take you as my beloved spouse, to have and to hold, and to mercilessly short stocks with, until profit do us part. As we embark on this bearish journey, let us unite our portfolios and short investment thesis"".

In Rizzley's hometown of Btfdville, most ppl were chill. Being a bull was the status quo while being a bear was a no go. Rizzley always felt that this was unfair, which is why the bulls' ego he wanted to tear. Rizzley, always a contrarian at heart, wanted to break their illusion apart. He prowled the investing landscape for the most robust stock, seeking the bulls' cherished gem among the flock. Lo and behold  Nvidia,bursting with buying pressure and bullish charisma. Rizzley found his target, and set about to make the stock bleed red like Target.
He wrote various DD's on WSB, spamming the post with meteor emojis ☄️☄️☄️. Rizzley put up his short thesis flyers in various places in Btfdville, the parks, stop signs, Wendy's, even on the traffic lights' red circle 🔴 . He married his brother to the Hindenburg Research CIO. He shared his rationale to various renowned publications of his town, such as the Grizzly Gazzete, Regarded Writings and Crayon Chronicles. He even released a book, ""The Bear's Den: Where Optimism Goes to Hibernate"". In it, he was quoted as saying ""bulls are like ostriches with their heads in the sand. They refuse to see the truth. All of this Al talk is hype lol. They'll learn soon enough, the hard way hopefully"".

Convinced NVIDIA would fall, and WSB's bearish echo chamber bolstering his appetite, he went all in on NDA puts.
He sold everything he had, including himself (worked extra shifts behind Wendy's dumpster). Believing this play wouldn't go tits up, he decided to hibernate. When he will wake up, he'd be richer than Jordan Belfort in 98’. After 69 days, he rose from his slumber, first thing he did is look at Lambos and was stuck on what color. After he ordered on uber his supper (salmon seasoned with bulls' crushed hopes and dreams, the more the better), he sat at his monitor and viewed his portfolio. To his utter
dismay, NVIDIA had made a ALL TIME HIGH TODAY (currently at $295.47). His portfolio was shredded , pain in his heart now embedded. His puts now nearly worthless, shattered the bear who was once fearless. He didn't know what to say, think, or do, only managed a GUH as ControltheNarrative did too.
He eventually regained some composure, and begged the market for this to be over. When he shouted ""THIS ISNT FAIR"", that’s his mans, Burry, walked in, ""Honey, your salmon
is here, seasoned perfectly to our liking, tonight, we shall feast like vikings.” With tears streaming down his face, Rizzly knew that he had just lost their place 🏡. The monitor, with one hand he tried to cover, and with the other halt his mate's enter. However, it was too late. Burry saw the look on Rizzly's face and[knew of their fate.](https://i.postimg.cc/WzZRfDhR/092-D691-D-7-CEC-4-BB2-9243-DF297382-DF94.jpg)

Alas, my fellow regards, he was never a bear, but an ostrich with too much flair.
And I, what positions do I hold? Why 30 NVIDIA 285p's of course, all told.

😏 TLDR: BUY NVDA PUTS ☄️☄️☄️",2023-05-16

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-26.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean ""cheaper."" High numbers mean ""expensive."" A 1 means ""fairly"" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.

"Hey Reddit!

Last week [I asked to you all to give me a stock and its main competitor](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13iao0c/give_me_a_stock_and_name_me_its_main_competitor_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I can do an in deep stock analysis on them and here I am! Keep in mind that what you are going to read is just a small pice of a 30 page thesis and analysis on the company, I also made a financial model too! took me a lot of time and effort, but I am happy I can deliver!

Just want to know the main takes? just read the TL:DR, but for an in deep analysis of the fundamentals you need to read also the pdf paper I have, just dm me if you are curious!

P.S. if you want to read the whole paper [here](https://www.charoenlai.com/en/post/intel-corporation-stock-evaluation-price-target), there I talk and analyse the company's financial stability, ratios and margins and future plans too

TL:DR

>**INTC Price $32; Price Range Target: $29 to $36**  
>  
>**AMD Price $109; Price Range Target: $98 to $120**  
>  
>*The global chip industry is facing challenges of shortages and oversupply, leading to a decline in market capitalization. Factors such as rising interest rates, high inflation, diminished consumer confidence, and stock market retreats have contributed to this decline. The industry still faces elevated lead times and a shortage of certain types of chips. Geopolitical factors, such as the conflict in Ukraine and US export regulations, also impact the industry. Companies are implementing cost-cutting measures and reducing expenditures. There are opportunities for the industry to focus on manufacturing closer to home, digital transformation, talent management, and achieving environmental goals. Different regions have different strategies for their semiconductor supply chains. Intel, as a leading semiconductor company, faces competition from AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, TSMC, and Samsung.*  
>  
>*Intel's financial performance has declined due to market conditions, high expenses, and cash flow challenges. The company is working to manage working capital, but its profitability and returns on investment have decreased. Future forecasts suggest potential growth in earnings.*  
>  
>*Based on the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, Intel's value is estimated to be at least $148 billion, with a fair value per share of around $32. Accounting for a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $29 and $36. Using Graham's Fair Value model, Intel's ideal price is calculated to be $58.45. Applying Graham's Number formula, the Fair Value is determined to be $32.51, which aligns closely with the price estimated by the DCF model. Overall, the fair value of Intel's stock ranges between $29 and $58.45, depending on the methodology used.*  
>  
>*With the DCF Model AMD's value is estimated to be at least $173 billion, with a fair value per share of around $109. Considering a 10% margin of error, the fair value range is between $98 and $120. Using Graham's Fair Value model, AMD's ideal price is calculated to be $103, which aligns closely with the value estimated by the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Applying Graham's Number formula, a Fair Value of $26 is obtained. This suggests that a significant portion of AMD's market value may be driven by market sentiment.*  
>  
>*Intel is currently facing scrutiny from investors and customers due to perceived stagnation and a lack of innovation. However, the company's strong financial position, substantial revenues, valuable assets, and favorable relations with the US government indicate that it is far from being on the verge of collapse. While competition has increased, Intel remains a powerful company capable of influencing markets and generating wealth. It is expected that this increased competition will serve as a catalyst for Intel to revive its innovation and competitiveness in the industry.*

# Background

Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation.

# Purpose

The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy.

# Methodology

Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods:

* Discounted Free Cash Flow
* Graham's Fair Value
* Graham's Number

# Industry Outlook

**Overview**

The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022.

Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated.

Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects:

* Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain.
* Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management.
* Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others.
* Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability.

In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient.

It's important to note that ""chips"" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more.

The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions.

# Main Competitors

Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry:

* **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):** AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings.
* **NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA):** While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions.
* **Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM):** Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions.
* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC):** TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs.
* **Samsung Electronics (005930)**: Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors.

These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC.

# Fair Value

Taking in Mind the projected forecast of the previous section, it is derived the Fair Value of a single piece of the Company's stock with three different methodologies: Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity; Graham's Fair Value Graham Number.

**Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity**

Plugging in the number and the assumptions, it is concluded that Intel Corporation is worth, at its current conditions, operations, assents, market share and potential cash flow at least 148 Billions US dollars. While its Fair Market Capitalisation shall be at least 134 Billions US dollars, which meat a Fair Value per share around the 32 USD price tag. Considering an error of 10%, its fair value fluctuates between $29 and $36

**Graham's Fair Value**

The Fair Value model, with a multiplier of 1, EPS of 1.9 and P/E of 15.4, we can calculate Intel's ideal price tag, which is $58.45.

**Graham's Number**

By using the Father of Value Investing's formula, with a multiplier of 22.5, we can extract a Fair Value of 32.51 Dollars, which is really close to the price tag we got with the DCFE model with realised before.

# Conclusions

**Disclaimer**

We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research.

**The Future**

Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a ""systems foundry"" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years.

**Conclusions**

INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.

All eyes on JPOW… 5/18/23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Daily Market Analysis,2023-05-18
"Well it would appear for now the trend of two days of shorts covering and rallying is continuing. This momentum should come to an end tomorrow if the trend holds true… we will know for sure if that happens if we close a doji tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s8qohjfosn0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e57511094b00278b8dc94c2ed9e1152eadb9975f

We surprisingly have no data tomorrow morning However we will have two fed speakers (the last of the 14 that spoke this week I believe) and then the granddad of them all… JPOW himself will be speaking at 11am regarding “Due to participate in a panel discussion titled ""Perspectives on Monetary Policy"" at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, in Washington DC.” 

Now if you know JPOW he has a history of walking up to the mic and haven’t a lasting effect on the markets… we should absolutely expect some high volatility tomorrow. The most interesting thing to note that we will hear tomorrow is whether or not JPOW expects an additional rate hike in June. Any hint at another rate hike I would suspect that we see a pretty negative reaction. However, if he hints even briefly at a pause we likely could see a huge move up. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3stmlmuosn0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89002c555ff27f78f1725149164deb38ec9dfff8

What truly is intriguing to me is that leading up to Jackson hole in August we did see a rally much like the last two days. The day before Jackson Hole closed at 419.51 and today we closed extremely close at that 419.23 level. This is the highest the markets has been in about 9 months. 

As you can see we maintain this big rising wedge with the critical resistance and pivot point of 419.5. From here the way I see it is simple… tomorrow decides whether we start a move back to 405.3 or we start our next leg up and look for the 430s for the first time in 9 months. The rising wedge resistance sits at 422.07 for tomorrow. 

From here if we can close over 419.5 then the target would be 429.7 by end of next week. However, if this 419.5 becomes a nice double top or we get a nice doji reversal then I would start to think about that magnet 410-412 range. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Support- 416.8 -> 414.9 -> 412.3  
 Resistance- 422.1 -> 425.1

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y7f2secpsn0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2c8d57e270659521bc7e6c97f865622f656b862c

Now on futures this is where we have quite a bit of a difference in trend and levels… Jackson hole for Futes was at the 4283 level. However we closed at 4212 on futes which is where we have found support and resistance numerous times over the last year. 

As of right now the black rising wedge remains in tact and tomorrows resistance for that sits at 4265. We have not on futures at least taken out the resistance area of 4215 to 4237 yet. This could provide a nice top. However, the daily candle here would suggest further upside tomorrow. The next major area of resistance that we will be looking for is the august highs around 4310 to 4395. The 4300s will remain the next target if this bullish momentum can continue. 

A backtest and confirmation of 4191 support would confirm upside momentum. That 4191 level provided resistance for a long time and bulls being able to turn that into support would be a huge win in their books. 

Daily futures Levels  
 Support- 4191 -> 4171 -> 4152  
 Resistance- 4236 -> 4280 -> 4310

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l6mfj1wpsn0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c3341d242b3ffcc4974bc29024b77a12e09b1260

Now as impressively as bullish as everybody is out there… my one little bit of hesitation on truly being bullish is the fact that the VIX is coming not major support… as you can see 16.07 was major support and now that we have breached that the next target would be 15.78. 

The one question I would ask everyone is this… Going into a major event like JPOW speaking with the VIX only 3.3% away from its 52week low is the risk to the upside or to the downside? While its obviously not impossible for bulls to have another green day to end the week and to see the VIX see off to a new 52 week low… (a negative -6.7% drop on the VIX gets us into the 14s…) I would definitely say the risk is to the downside on SPY not the upside… It will be much harder for the bulls to continue this rally with the VIX at this level. 

However, IF JPOW comes out and re-assures the markets that all is well… no recession, we might pause and that banks are super strong… well honestly that could be enough to get the VIX into its extreme reversion to mean 12-14 area that we have not seen since 2019. So ask yourself this before you fomo in at 420 and VIX 15/16… are we really in a market status and time frame like 2019? Or is this more 2020-2023? 

I think we are setting up for one amazing long put opportunity myself. I will be watching the VIX and SPY closely at EOD tomorrow for a possible 90-120dte put entry. 

**DXY and 10YR YIELD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bqzuxvdqsn0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=52b8b4aa275f7c59b632f02a5dd415d58077ae9c

Honestly what truly is blowing my mind right now is the fact that the dollar and the 10yr has been rallying in sync with us…. The last time DXY was at this level was March 20th when SPY closed at 393.74 and the last time the 10YR was at this level was March 15th when SPY closed at 389.28… call it $391 average and SPY is sitting almost $30 higher then it was last time DXY/ 10YR saw these levels… 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v4cp3huqsn0b1.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3ba7a45e4d91fbd0b70d50eb138346a48d0bd278

Despite the real rollercoaster of a day that SPY had I actually had a really solid trading day. This week is shaping up to be just as amazing as the last 2 weeks of trading. I still have my NVDA and TSLA puts that are absolutely worthless and even with that loss I will realize tomorrow this is going to turn out to be a great week. 

I play to trade fairly lightly once JPOW starts talking and I honestly don’t hate the idea of a straddle going into it if premiums and IV are not too outrageous. IV is pretty low for tomorrow still and only have about a $3 move priced in… now that is 150% of the priced in move almost every single day this week so realistically a $4-5 move is probable tomorrow… meaning we either close the week out near 425 or near 415…",2023-05-18

>TL;DR: If we close above 419.5 we are looking to test the 430s by end of next week.

Trading Nvidia earnings next week: Analysts say ‘AI gold rush’ should boost outlook,2023-05-18
"NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) price target was raised at Oppenheimer and Susquehanna ahead of its earnings release after the close on Wednesday, May 24.

Oppenheimer analysts raised the firm's price target on the stock to $350 from $300, maintaining an Outperform rating. They told investors they see upside to the company's print and outlook.

""DC expected up through the year as cloud vendors scale-out AI infrastructure. ChatGPT has sparked a sense of urgency some are calling ""AI's iPhone moment"". AI models continue to grow and proliferate. NVDA's full stack hardware/software platform remains the cornerstone to an expanding AI ecosystem,"" they wrote. ""DC, high-performance gaming, and auto are a triple play for sustained growth.""

Susquehanna analysts raised the price target on Positive-rated NVDA to $350 from $310 per share. The analysts said the AI arms race should drive a constructive DC outlook.

""Overall, we expect better results/guidance, driven largely by the ongoing AI gold rush and subsequent DC GPU demand,"" they said. ""We are expecting great things from DC, with Gaming continuing its recovery.""

Elsewhere, Deutsche Bank analysts, who have a Hold rating and $220 price target on NVDA, said they expect a solid report and guidance.

There is ""room for upside vs. the Street in both as the ever-growing list of potential applications for AI has driven strong demand for NVDA's leading AI compute processors,"" they added.

""We expect the AI-enthusiasm to carry the day and likely continue to provide a strong safety net for the share price despite its somewhat amazing +107% appreciation YTD.""

"So i tried posting this and accidentally misspelled a ticker and post got removed..

If you have not been following along, I have been YOLOing my entire portfolio hundreds of times over the last few years.

I started with about 200k and went a slow as $875... Recently hit a high of about 525k, then back down to $174k last week.

Today at market close the portfolio value is back up to $503k.

I sold the BABA and most of the MPW and BILI calls from last post. About 100% profit total.

I kept $44k of MPW calls, and Today i opened a bunch of puts on QQQ, NVDA, AMD, and SPY ($425k) expiring next week. 

For earnings tomorrow i bought 25k of BABA $90 calls, and $7k in Walmart puts expiring friday..

Love u Regards, ill update u again when i get a chance...

"Its relatively cheap compared to NVDA valuation.

With Tesla at least you get robots(Optimus), X AI(Chat GPT competitor), cars and trucks, road data for autonomous driving,  SpaceX, Twitter, Hyper Loop, The Boring Company, Solar City, Star Link and neuralink. This guy has a hand in every industry.

TSLA is turning into skynet from terminator.

I see TSLA going up atleast 40% from here. $300 min.

TSLA received alot of analyst downgrades after their recent quarter but after the shareholder meeting i think the stock will be re-evaluated. Institutional portfolio managers(big money) are waiting for buy ratings before they put in their orders. Its how the industry works.

Im obviously kidding about skynet but this is what Elon is afraid of. we need regulations.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-19.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean ""cheaper."" High numbers mean ""expensive."" A 1 means ""fairly"" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.
* **How should this be improved?** Do you have any suggestions or notice any bugs with this report?",2023-05-18

The bull case from here is honestly pitiful,2023-05-17
"All the zirp normies will say otherwise but it is literally all predicated on tulip mania like thinking. At current interest rates the S&P/Naz are more overvalued now then when rates were zero in Nov 2021. Half the justifications for longing profitless shitcos is “fed will bring interest rates back to zero and my stocks will moon”. Think about that for a second, that is a majority of the bull thesis these days🫡

Literally like 6 stocks are controlling the entire market. Take NVDA, it literally says “AI” 98.6 times on earnings while trading at >150x earnings and rallies 100% in 6 months lmao. It is now larger than Berkshire Hathaway lololololol

Meanwhile the Russell 2000 has literally been taken out back like a horse, executed, turned into glue, and eaten by regards that are buying tech stocks. 

I’m not saying mega bear doom lord outcome. Businesses will still continue to grow after some slight recession. It is just the price at which people are willing to buy these companies will change drastically.",2023-05-17

Sun Microsystems' letter to bagholders after Dot Com burst,2023-05-18
"Sun peaked at a $200bn market cap in 2000 & then crashed and was sold for $7bn to Oracle. Their Price to Revenue ratio at the peak was only 10!

They had actual decent products too: 
From Java to SPARC processors, StarOffice, MySQL, Solaris OS, VirtualBox & ZFS!
They were involved in all important areas of tech.

This is what the CEO wrote to bagholders:

“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?” 

He was highly regarded, little he knew... NVDA with Price to Revenue of 28 to the moon!

Edit: Added Sun products for our crayon lovers!",2023-05-18

">I find it amusing that the CEO of Sun Microsystems was so dismissive of his own company's stock price. At 10 times revenues, Sun would have had to pay its shareholders 100% of its revenue for 10 years straight in order to provide a 10-year payback. Obviously, this is not sustainable and is completely unrealistic. It just goes to show how irrational people can be when it comes to investing!",2023-05-18

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-19.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean ""cheaper."" High numbers mean ""expensive."" A 1 means ""fairly"" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.

Did we just break the Trendy Range? 5-16-23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Daily Market Analysis,2023-05-16
"IT would appear for now we are still holding this critical 4131-4153 range on futures and 411.6 to 413.5 range on SPY. We continue to range… the question is with now our 7th straight day of consolidation what is the market waiting for? What is going to snap the markets out of consolidation?

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mv1i5r3l990b1.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=de49f41d2a1a9a0ff4d4065cd752c49e8daf8816

Well we are back to the road of rebalancing SPY! We put in a new supply (resistance) at 413.02 and have taken out that 411.15 supply. In doing so we now should look for the next closest demand (underneath). 404.3 to 405.06 are the closets demands and with a closure under the daily 8 and 20ema I would be looking for that area tomorrow IF we can get a bigger day of movement and get some continuation to this EOD sell off. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pxlk4ril990b1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bdd9b7cdd9c2528f04b1a9e290c75ed9ed946b61

Taking a look here at here at the daily price action we are now closed under the daily 20ema. The last support to test here would be the black rising wedge support at 409.37 for tomorrow. IF we break through that and more importantly if we close under that we should start to look for that 405.2 area. 

We also have a gap to fill from 403.74 to 408.64 that could be a target for tomorrow…

SPY has officially broken the 410.9 to 413.9 range that it has closed within for the last 7 trading days leading into today. This could finally be the break we have been looking for. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 413 -> 415.6  
 Demand- 411.6 -> 405.1  
 Support- 410.2 -> 408.9 -> 408 -> 407

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/msstcjxl990b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=507c486be7d0d014843074c9bae17ec43384f644

One of the scenarios I was looking for was the double top off 4149 to establish a new lower supply (resistance) and that actually is the scenario that played out! With this new supply at 4149 and presumably closing under 4132 demand (support) which is our main range we should look for a move lower tomorrow… we also are seeing a closure under the daily 8 and 20ema… 

Favoritism would go for a move as low as 4074 demand. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gb5rs6dm990b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3853375ace48e4a20740ed88ae025fd80ac8fec3

There is a very slim chance with this huge recoil here that futes at 5pm could close over 4131… that would negate some of this breakdown out of the range… however, presumably I do see it closing below. With the really nice double top off 4149 followed by a bearish daily engulfing candle then we should look for the black support line to be touch at 4116.

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4149 -> 4153  
 Demand- 4131 -> 4074  
 Support- 4131 -> 4110   
 Resistance- 4149 -> 4180

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hg95gkqm990b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce5c01d91eff64e79d98dad9be31176f7358d11c

Biggest thing to note here is that the VIX FINALLY broke through and CLOSED over key 17.75 resistance… this range on the VIX actually is the same range that spy has been in… 16.79 to 17.75 was the range equivalent to the 411.6 to 413.5… now that VIX closed over and SPY closed under that range the favoritism would go to further sell off on spy coordinated by VIX moving up. 

DXY did bounce today also and needs to take out that key 102.73 level… we also saw a huge breakout on the 10YR yield today too over that 3.522% and the Next major level is 3.607%.

Overall a really solid day of trading.. I really killed it in the morning and then struggled in that mid day extreme chop. Overall the week is off to a great start and look to continue building the gains into the EOW… I did risk some profits on small LOTTOS over night…

I currently am swinging Tsla 160P based on the annual share holder meeting today… I also took some NVDA 287.5P and AAPL 167.5P based on their underlying supply/ demand charts. I also decided to open some swing SPY 410P.

Goal will be to close them all at open if they underlying moves how I would like. I might hold them too just depends… they are very small sized lottos about 20-25% of my normal sized position.",2023-05-16

"The big short 2.5… 5-15-23 SPY/ ES Futures, and VIX Daily Market Analysis",2023-05-15
"Well today was pretty much as expected… a small about $3 range day with insanely tight consolidation… Tonights TA will be pretty short and simple to the point due to how boring this price action was… 

Back in believe December 2022 I did a post called “the big short 2.0” well let me tell you (I didn’t take any plays) that was the biggest bust ever (if you took the plays)… so im hear to present you THE BIG SHORT 2.5! 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gn0urny4i20b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b171beca0603ee539ceeaf625acec9752e9bbe98

Based on my calculations factoring in PE, F Pe, Peg, and interaction with weekly 20ema, ATH, and the 2020 lows… NVDA is actually the most favorable short followed by Apple, AMD and MSFT. Impressively META and TSLA actually come in at the least shortable stock right now.

I think one thing that’s really mind boggling to me is the fact that APPLE is only 6% from its ATH, and the fact that AMD has a PE ratio of 394.94!!!! Also Amazon forward PE of 67.01 and Nvidia PEG of 4.04 are impressively stupid too. 

Okay that was just for fun… I AM NOT TAKING ANY PLAYS OFF THAT… just presenting some data to stir up conversations… (will re-evaluate mid summer to see how they would have paid). 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9bvd7ng5i20b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b43f00fe2f9ca030777a7f0281e0b2f6d4063fdc

The imbalance on SPY daily continues… so before we had the issue that we were trading/ closing candles over the established supply… I said that the only way to fix this was to sell off or establish a new demand… today with that EOD pump and of course a long wick to the downside… we did just that. 

With a new demand (support) at 411.59 the favoritism goes to the upside with a target of 415.56 to 417.03. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r7t6cav5i20b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=95a03b28f7b27dc2ca1a206193846e555b30e682

On SPY daily we did poke through that 3 point resistance line. With that it could be an indication that we are going to push to the upside. However, if you look at the daily price action you can see we are clearly still in a range and realistically what most probably is going to happen is we continue to push these support/ resistance lines out until we finally see a sustainable breakout or breakdown. 

We are attempting and realistically establishing 411.6 as a major support area now. The major resistance still lies in that 413.4 to 414.7 area though. 

As long as SPY continues to close candles over the daily 8ema I am neutral to bullish… as I said last week I do believe it is still too early to short…

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 411.1 -> 415.6  
 Demand- 411.6 -> 405  
 Support- 411.6 -> 408.8  
 Resistance- 413.5 -> 414.7 -> 415.9

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eefi3pa6i20b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f225a5138c02de28370124ce206d3d0be7afd1ca

Futures and SPY are now back on track together with Futes also putting in a new demand (Support). With todays new demand at 4131 it actually lowers the current demand from 4134 (takes it out) to the current 4131. 

Support being established at 4131 means we start to look at the next supply (resistance) which sits at 4153 then 4190. If you remember from Friday that supply was re-confirmed (hence the dashed line instead of normal solid) which means we should look at 4153 as a major resistance area. 

It is probable that we do reject here but also the biggest thing to note is that the last 7 candles have no closed within this 4131 to 4153 range… 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uoszv3r6i20b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c7714c13b8df914b84f1ce3653bf4da8be68fa6d

Price action wise with this really nice double bottom off 4131 and establishing a new demand (support) I would definitely look for the upside here.. it should be noted that we still have not broken through that blue resistance line which has 4 touches on it… that resistance sits at 4155 for tomorrow and that is what we will call our line in our sand…

A wick through 4155 but more importantly a closure OVER 4153 tomorrow would indicate the potential for a bigger move up to that 4190 to 4198 area. 

However, if we truly are range bound there actually is a high probability that we reject tomorrow with a double top off 4150 and close somewhere near 4130-4135. IF this happens we actually are likely to see a new supply (resistance) established below 4153. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4153 -> 4190  
 Demand- 4131 -> 4074  
 Support- 4131 -> 4110  
 Resistance- 4153 -> 4180

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gpw54f87i20b1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b087f7e1e7ab75c9fe9c2e38a6d7ec9a1fe217f9

Interestingly enough… the VIX actually closed green today AND SPY closed green… actually even more interestingly is that the VIX closed a 0.29%+ and futures closed at exactly 0.29%+… I actually do not know if I have ever seen that happen before…

The VIX this morning was up about 3-4% before it finally started to sell off… it attempted to break through that 17.72 resistance level, however, once again failed and ended up coming back to that key 17.1 support area. 

The VIX continues to be sandwiched in that 16.79 to 17.72 area with the mean reversion being to 17.1 area. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

Really couldn’t have asked for a better way to start the week off… pulled in 75% of my weekly goal today. 

While these extremely tight ranges… where spy closes within a 30-50 cent range for 2 hours or more… are extremely annoying and I would much rather play a bigger range, I have truly finally been able to capitalize on these movements. 

The one thing that I will always love about SPY is that it is predictable, chartable, and tradeable in all conditions… 2022 challenged me to be a better trader and to adapt to the ever changing market and volatility… so far in 2023 we are now learning how to be better range traders… 2022 and 2023 have been learning experiences that any of us who survive will use as tools to be better traders and prosper for the rest of our trading careers.",2023-05-15

"NVDA is the best example of the ""market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent"".

It will come down, but the question is when. I got burnt twice on trying to short NVDA, and will not touch it again until we have a clear downtrend (like TSLA did last fall).",2023-05-15

Volume tickers in play,2023-05-15
"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.",2023-05-15

Third time is a charm? Nearing the End - long post,2023-05-14
" I haven't posted here in awhile mostly because I havent had much to say. But I think the next couple of weeks will be interesting. I hate people who waffle so here's what I am saying in case you don't want to read the long post: the VIX is going higher and the market is going lower and there is already evidence the house of cards is teetering.

I am not going to discuss the terrible breadth in the market, or what the VIX is actually signaling the market will do in the next couple of months (move in a 1% range), or the fact that we are being invaded at our southern border, or that the market returns are largely due to five stocks, or that CMG has a PE of 55, Salesforce 961 PE, Zoom 187, NVDA 162, or that earnings were terrible if you remove cost cutting measures etc. None of that matters either apparently.

# When will this tight range end?

Way back in February, I posted somewhat jokingly that what would drive everyone nuts is if the SP500 pinned itself to the 4000 level. Here we are in June and thats effectively what its done. I've posted about my frustration, my bewilderment and then my conviction that when it does break, it will be to the downside.

Whats important is not to take one or two data points and then deduct a result that is full of confirmation bias. However, I believe we are close - like next two weeks close - to this market being able to break out of this range.

A couple of points (thanks again to my expat genius on Twitter @/frankoz95967943 who learned me the very complex details of this) - all of these I have discussed at length in posts on my sub):

1. VIX is being suppressed artificially. I have covered how in previous posts. Simplest way to know is to look at HYG. It normally correlates. Not anymore.
2. Oil is also being suppressed. Again, if oil rises, everything else rises in price. The Fed does not want inflation. Best way to fight inflation is to keep oil down. I've shared how they are doing this in previous posts. (links at the end)
3. The Japanese are the major fbuddy helping the Fed do all of this.

I have to tell you that in +30 years in the market managing assets, I have not seen a market like this before. It is unnatural and controlled. That's why the VIX keeps dropping when risk keeps rising. I have posted at great length about the outlier risks that currently exist (Ukraine, banks, etc.) so no need to get into that again.

# WHY IS IT DIFFERENT NOW?

So a couple of things have happened and a couple are scheduled to happen that have caused me to go out on a limb and say this: what the Fed can control is limited and the end is near. Yes, the Fed can print money ad infinitum, like they have been doing, and the Japanese can play their role, but at some point, outside events will occur that they cannot control. Even with the help of the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon and JPM.

Here is what has happened recently:

# TRIGGER #1: OIL being manipulated is close to being out of US hands:

1. As I postulated earlier, because the US keeps hammering down the price of oil, eventually those countries whose GDP is based on oil might decide they've had enough. Well, OPEC+ is communicating they've had enough.
   1. [Saudi Minister Says OPEC+ Could Cut Production At Any Time | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Saudi-Minister-Says-OPEC-Could-Cut-Production-At-Any-Time.html)
2. Then there is this: [Iraq And Iran Ignore U.S. Sanctions In Talks To Expand Energy Ties | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Middle-East/Iraq-And-Iran-Ignore-US-Sanctions-In-Talks-To-Expand-Energy-Ties.html)
3. There this: [Syria’s normalization signals a new Middle Eastern order (brookings.edu)](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2023/05/10/syrias-normalization-signals-a-new-middle-eastern-order/) <----- Let's not forget that Assad is a war criminal. So bad that the Arab league suspended Syria's membership in 2011.
   1. Of course, the NeoCons in the US govt respond by doing this: [US lawmakers introduce bill to combat normalization with Syria's Assad (yahoo.com)](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-combat-135934548.html)

The Middle East seems to be getting MORE peaceful, not less, Israel excluded of course. Why? I think its because they see that they have a shot at gaining more control over their regional politics AND perhaps a chance to wean themselves off of the US dollar dependance.

If the price of oil is allowed to trade freely, its going up. Period. If the price of oil goes up, inflation goes up.

# RESULT: If oil goes up, inflation goes up, and then the Fed will truly lose control.

# TRIGGER #2: DEBT CEILING TALKS

Lots of news lately about the debt ceiling. Of course the debt ceiling would not be a problem if the US just spent LESS but thats a moot point since thats not going to happen. I don't know if the US will default, probably not a full default anyway. BUT, the mere appearance of the possibility of the US defaulting will cause risk assets to plummet.

1. [Biden and Hill leaders postpone debt meeting as deal talks continue - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/11/debt-limit-meeting-between-biden-and-hill-leaders-postponed-00096548)
2. [McCarthy was 'disrespectful' in Biden meeting on debt limit, sources say (nbcnews.com)](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/mccarthy-was-disrespectful-in-biden-meeting-on-debt-limit-sources-say-173870149509) \- what a bunch of children.
3. [McCarthy blasts Biden after White House debt ceiling meeting (axios.com)](https://www.axios.com/2023/05/09/mccarthy-biden-white-house-debt-ceiling-meeting)

Look, they will raise the debt ceiling at some point. The question is how long it will take and who will blink first. However, the longer it takes, the more nervous the markets become.

Don't forget this too: ***The Treasury General Account fell to $154 billion, down from $184 billion on May 9th. In fact, at this rate, the account will be EMPTY on May 19th. OPEX.***

Don't be fooled by the chatter of deals and more deals. Yes, a deal will get done but the point is the SP500 is not trading like there is any concern.

# RESULT: The empty TGA will force the US government to RAISE rates it offers to investors to fund operations. Raising rates is bad for the market.

# TRIGGER #3: SHORT SELLING BAN on bank stocks.

Beyond the hypocrisy of this, compounded by the fact that other than Yellen, the main spokesperson trumpeting this idea is the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon, is the fact that the last time they did this in 2008 after Lehman, 3 months later the XLF was down 51%.

1. [JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wants US regulators to consider a ban on the short selling of bank stocks | Business Insider India](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-wants-us-regulators-to-consider-a-ban-on-the-short-selling-of-bank-stocks/articleshow/100169845.cms)
2. [Calls to Investigate Short Sellers Intensify as Bank Crisis Deepens - The New York Times (nytimes.com)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/12/business/dealbook/jamie-dimon-short-sellers-banks.html) <---short sellers as being blamed for bank failures - thats rich.
3. Oddly the SEC says nope.
4. TREASURY SECRETARY YELLEN TO MEET TOP BANK CEOS NEXT WEEK IN WASHINGTON: POLITICO <---- prob to discuss the $18b they are going to force on the banks to recapitalize the bank insurance fund.
5. Discussions of raising the FDIC limit to infinity <--- this is bank nationalization or rather, JPM et al.

# RESULT: A BAN WILL ONLY OCCUR IF ANOTHER BANK IS ABOUT TO FAIL - this is the only reason. IF IT OCCURS, BYE BYE MARKET.

# TRIGGER #4: MONEY IS LEAVING AAPL.

AAPL is close to an all time high. As AAPL goes so goes the market. AAPL's earnings S U C K E D unless you are a fan of gains due to outsourcing of labor overseas. Also, Foxconn, AAPL's largest supplier, reported a 56% drop in net income ( [Apple supplier Foxconn's Q1 profit plunges, outlook ""conservative"" | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-supplier-foxconns-q1-profit-falls-56-yy-worse-than-forecasts-2023-05-11/) ). Oh and Samsung Electronics profit fell 95% in first quarter. But yeah, AAPL is fine.

But while the stock is going up, money is leaving:

1. 2 billion left the stock May 5
   1. Money flowed in May 10th
2. Then this past Friday, 7 billion - and no its not repositioning or some other reason.

https://preview.redd.it/v1pmmktrypza1.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=19948a3be1f8e22977f858715ba1b1481db94995

***Since Jan 1, AAPL has added $760,000,000,000 in market cap. Sure, that makes sense.***

# RESULT: AAPL rolling over will pull the techs and the rest of the market down.

# All it will take is FOR ONE OF THE ABOVE THINGS TO HAPPEN and the market goes down.

# But wait, thats not all. Here are some possible ""canaries in the coal mine"":

# The VVIX, which is the volatility of the VIX, is going UP when the VIX is being manipulated going down. HUH?

1. The UAE announced a $10 billion short position on US stocks last week. What's odd is how public this announcement was.
   1. I believe this was another warning to Washington to knock off their manipulation of the oil markets.
   2. Our government responded 2 days later that they would start buying to refill the markets in June. What?? Why would you communicate when you will buy in the open markets? The US has publicly stated they will only buy when oil is $67-$72 per barrel. Either the US thinks thats where oil will be or they are communicating to OPEC+ (the + is for Russia) that they will be done screwing around in June.

# OTHER RISK BEING IGNORED:

1. US Banks - not any better regardless of what Yellen and JP and the devil say. There is a structural problem with regional banks: they cannot compete unless they take on more risk and that has led to them taking on more risk which is why the banking system is set to collapse - collapse into a national banking system, run by the devil of course. I am not a conspiracy theorist - if you understand how much money the TBTF banks are getting for less than 1% from the Fed, you understand that regionals dont have a chance.
2. Ukraine - there is still a war going on. People are dying. The US public is done caring about Ukraine having moved on to better things.
3. China / Taiwan - probably not this summer since Taiwan is going to be having an election in 2024 and if the KMT party wins, unification, i mean war is called off: China wins, without a single shot being fired. By the way, this is the great idea our leaders Washington have if China invades: [US Threatens To 'Blow Up' Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Firm If China Invades The Island; Taipei Unhappy (eurasiantimes.com)](https://eurasiantimes.com/us-threatens-to-blow-up-taiwans-semiconductor-manufacturing/) WHEN YOU HAVE FRIENDS LIKE US...
4. Commercial real estate market is already crashing but of course, nothing to be concerned about
   1. Here's a jewel in San Fran that was valued at $300m two years ago, now on sale for the low price of $60m ( [Commercial real estate in SF grapples with 350 California's expected (hoodline.com)](https://hoodline.com/2023/05/smaller-commericial-real-estate-san-francisco-versus-350-california-expected-to-drop-over-80/)
   2. And this in NYC that was valued at $125 m two years ago just sold for $13 million ( [Turtle Bay Residential Building Sells at 90% Discount (therealdeal.com)](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2023/05/04/failed-startups-turtle-bay-building-sells-at-90-discount/)
   3. CRE debt is a mess. I've already discussed it at length in previous posts. [Defaults on Commercial Real Estate Loans Surge to 14-Year High (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/distressed-cre-loans-rose-to-5-2-in-february-7373644) <--- this was a January article.
   4. Trucking rates are WORSE than the 2019 ""Trucking Bloodbath"" when 10 large trucking companies went bk. Truck rates are down to $1.19/mile with operating costs up $.30 mile since then. This doesnt even include rising finance costs. (thanks to Craig Fuller@freightalley on Twitter).
5. Other items of interest are credit card chargeoffs higher than 2008 levels, rising auto loan delinquencies, poor tax collections, layoffs, BBBY bankruptcy (this would've normally crashed the market for a day or so due to their large real estate holdings). But yeah, there's no inflation.

# And really, the big data point to me that proves without a doubt the VIX is being manipulated is the following chart which shows that normally, like the last 15 years, when yields move higher, the VIX moves higher (historical R [correlation] of 71.21%). But not this time I guess. VIX is purple, Yields are green.

https://preview.redd.it/tipkjui2zpza1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=127eacdf3d0ec7b58beb36f345b85022d3a184b0

# CONCLUSION:All it will take is for one card to fall in this humongous house of cards. And I only listed a couple of them.

The US stock market is apparently not concerned. Since the VIX is sub 17 and headed to 0.

The FED is controlling what it can. They are running out of time and money.

The next two weeks are crucial and I have little confidence in Washington <--- they will screw up enough where they can't hide it.

# KEY EVENTS:

* OPEX this Friday
* TGA runs out of money - probably this Friday
* Debt ceiling talks get ulgier - already happening.

***Watch for these for a blow off top:***

1. ***Celebration over universal*** *~~healthcare~~* ***FDIC insurance.***
2. ***AAPL sets a new ATH***
3. ***VIX collapses below 14***

**Disclosure**: I am LONG VIX calls from June to October. Heavy. Like 50%. In my 30 years, buying low VIX was a trade I NEVER lost money on. I trade options, daytrade ES and teach FOR FREE others how to trade (live trading on Friday). I am paying it forward.

I don't care if you agree, because I am right. Read my name - this isnt advice.

Weekly Expected moves on major indices and tickers as well as notes,2023-05-14
" [https://i.postimg.cc/KcVxLxqt/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/KcVxLxqt/image.png)

Use these like any indicator, with caution. Basically gives you an understanding of when we start going into oversold or overbought territories.

1. This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers.
2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves. Obviously, if there are unexpected poison pills in an earnings report or if there are unexpected positive catalysts, you can move outside the deviations.
3. it's expected that 70% of the time we fall within the range by the end of the week/month/quarter. So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair it together with another tool called RSI. Most people are familiar with RSI. If we break out of the upper expected moves on already high RSI, this can create favorable short setups where you do have probabilities on your side. Now keep in mind point 1 & 2 that I made. You can have overbought + high RSI on individual tickers like MSFT and NVDA because of something that may fundamentally change the company like a new revenue stream. Hence why this is more useful on index-related products.
4. At the end of the day, this is all a game of probability. When you are oversold on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the upside. When you are overbought on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the downside.",2023-05-14

F*ck ur calls (Update #3) -FlipFlop,2023-05-13
"Well regards, it auction expiration Friday. That you all for the wonderful comments on the previous post highlighting how Cucked i was at market open. (Hit a low of -68% total)

I help yesterday's positions till about 2hrs before expiration. Screenshot of values was taking a bit before selling, ended up selling all those puts for a little less than that when market started going up after the screenshot. (Ended up selling for about +45% on the day total)

Then proceeded to buy weekly calls, shown in the other screenshot. Which went up as soon as i bought in and pushed the total daily profit to about +98%... Still holding those into next week.

Stay tuned for us getting cucked again next week. We got like $240k in weekly Calls on Chinese stocks.. and like $40k in crashing commercial real estate.. LMFAO.

See you guys later. Heading to the store to get some lube for next week. Yes im regarded. And yes we FLIP FLOPPED! F*CK UR PUTS!!! NEXT WEEK.",2023-05-13

How can AI help support my growing Wendy’s business - Dumpster Fun LLC?,2023-05-10
Volume tickers in play,2023-05-11
"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.",2023-05-11

F*ck your calls (Update 1),2023-05-09
"Well fellow regards. Sorry I couldnt answer the hundreds of messages individually. I'm too busy dealing with my heavy balls at the moment.

Moves: Yesterday before close, I got rid of the DKNG shares and bought back my calls, sold the 285 NVDA puts and put all the $ into 290 NVDA Puts (safer...) LOL.

I was planning on selling all these today mid day for about $45k profit overall and avoid the dice roll of CPI tomorrow pre market, but decided the WSB gods would be disappointed.

Instead, I held, down about $9k overall since opening the position/my previous post.

So here u go. Still holding and tomorrow premarket will make or break this regards life savings for the 500th time in the last couple years. Enjoy the anticipation and anxiety while I sleep like a baby knowing Theta gang can lick my huge balls. Oh and F*ck ur calls!

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-12.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""
* **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",2023-05-09

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-12.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""
* **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

Volume tickers in play,2023-05-08
"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.",2023-05-08

Use these like any indicator, with caution. Basically gives you an understanding of when we start going into oversold or overbought territories.

1. This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers.
2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves. Obviously, if there are unexpected poison pills in an earnings report or if there are unexpected positive catalysts, you can move outside the deviations.
3. it's expected that 70% of the time we fall within the range by the end of the week/month/quarter. So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair it together with another tool called RSI. Most people are familiar with RSI. If we break out of the upper expected moves on already high RSI, this can create favorable short setups where you do have probabilities on your side. Now keep in mind point 1 & 2 that I made. You can have overbought + high RSI on individual tickers like MSFT and NVDA because of something that may fundamentally change the company like a new revenue stream. Hence why this is more useful on index-related products.
4. At the end of the day, this is all a game of probability. When you are oversold on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the upside. When you are overbought on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the downside.",2023-05-08

">1. I agree that this is more useful for index-related products, as they are likely to see less volatility compared to individual stocks.
2. With earnings, options traders are often betting on the direction of the stock price move, which can cause implied volatility to go up. This expected move information can help you predict the range within which a stock is likely to trade after an earnings release. Obviously, if there are unexpected news items that could impact the stock price (positive or negative), then it may not fall within these expectations.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-12.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""
* **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",2023-05-08

Microsoft partnering with AMD,2023-05-05
Media report came out yesterday - Microsoft is bankrolling AMD to develop AI chips for it.   Shares jumped briefly to over 90$ yesterday afternoon. Backing from a major player like MSFT will give AMD a much needed push in the AI space that has been largely dominated by NVDA.  Hoping we can see AMD mirror NVDAs recent AI bull run.,2023-05-05

Volume tickers in play,2023-05-03
"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.",2023-05-03

NVDA bulls are delusional,2023-04-20
"The bulls are blind to the facts. The reason this went down today is because TSM showed in their quarterly results that their 5nm wafers actually decreased in revenues from last quarter. This nullifies the whole premise that AI will immensely improve revenues for NVDA Q1 results. Yet for some reason they are still hopeful for some generative AI to boost sales when it’s simply just not happening in the near future.

"The upcoming slowdown in chips -- not potato chips, but semiconductor chips you regard",2023-04-25
"# Preface

Listen up regards, on April 7th, Samsung posted its Q1 2023 guidance. In-case you were hiding under your mom's bed from her drunk bf that day, the results were worse than abysmal. Here is the headline you need to know according to the WSJ: *Samsung Forecasts Worst Profit in Over a Decade as Tech Slump Hits Memory Chips*.

* From $59 Billion rev. to $48 Billion year-over-year (YoY). A whopping -19% year-over-year drop.
* From $10.7 Billion operating profit to $455 Million YoY. -95.6%. That's a lot and it's the worst profit results since 2009 (percentage wise still less than what some of you regards lose on 0dte).

Did I also mention Samsung commands a 15.8% global marketshare of semis ([http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=110893](http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=110893))

As a result, Samsung declared ""meaningful"" cuts into production. ANALysts interpreted this as a win for Micron, which saw a ridiculous rally of 8% on April 10th, which has since melted away its gains as of April 25th. I hope you bought puts. I did.

What else happened leading up to April 10th? IDC released its Q1 2023 report ([https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS50565723](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS50565723)) which saw PC manufacturers shipping less computers YoY by an average of -29%. Apple was the star of this report, shipping -40.5% less computers.

It just keeps getting worse on April 10th, as TSMC reported its first drop in monthly revenue in almost four years. ([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tsmc-posts-first-revenue-drop-in-nearly-four-years-a020fe58](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tsmc-posts-first-revenue-drop-in-nearly-four-years-a020fe58)) Yeah you read that right, the same TSMC that Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway had recently liquidated 86% out of. ([https://www.reuters.com/technology/buffett-says-geopolitics-factor-berkshire-sale-tsmc-stake-2023-04-11/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/buffett-says-geopolitics-factor-berkshire-sale-tsmc-stake-2023-04-11/))

Fast forward to April 20h, where we have TSMC's earnings. While the bottom line EPS was a beat ($1.31 vs $1.21), its top line rev was $16.7 Billion, missing estimates of $17.3 Billion. TSMC's Q2 guidance came in between $15.2 and $16 Billion.

With all this shit guidance, you can't ignore what lay ahead. After all, semis requires a metric ton of capital. Foundries ain't cheap to build and operate, and you know what else ain't cheap? Interest rates, and we've yet begun to price it in. See where I'm going here?

# What's the deal?

Looking at the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index $SOX, it's clear it's running out of steam. Having formed a bearish divergence against the RSI, I'm expecting the worst. Don't believe me? Look at the charts for other semis - AMD, NVDA, INTC (lolz), QCOM, etc.

Since my wife's bf won't let me gamble options anymore in any serious capacity, I've resorted to triple leveraged ETFs so I can lose money three times as fast. I present to you SOXS.

My position? 1000 shares at a cost average of $19.66.

interested in Nvidia??,2023-04-25
"  

One that should interest you boys…

&#x200B;

Nvidia actually has some solid backing with HSBC doing a U-turn with a turnaround upgrade while Ertse also upgraded thinking that revenue will accelerate in 2024.

So with a year end target of $355 now, what can be done to best capture this?

Based off of $10k capital 

When filtering for more vanilla ,lower risk trades BB1 came up with this one;

A 345/355/3575 broken call fly 440 times, which would be;

\+440 345calls 12/15/23 expiry 

\-880 355calls 12/15/23 expiry

\+440 375calls 12/15/23 expiry 

You actually receive 13 cents for putting this on!

&#x200B;

[This is the trade](https://preview.redd.it/z2i0gzbpi1wa1.jpg?width=742&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a1c3fd234eecbe32349c7f0269bcf4a26438cc4a)

  

If this one is correct that’ll be a whopping 6488% return (INCLUDING COSTS AND SLIPPAGE!@!)

This is the heatmap for that trade, remember “green” is good, “red” is bad…..here you can see how it will move going forward 

&#x200B;

[this is a forward looking risk model that can be adjusted for high\/low volatility enviroments](https://preview.redd.it/0lkf23bui1wa1.jpg?width=792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8cacdaa8c3e7db85b8dc8cbc9fcada3f6ca37f9f)

  

Now for those of you that would like an even larger return and don’t mind having a little bit more risk, this one is very sexy indeed.

\+2000 305calls 12/15/23 expiry 

\-5000 355calls 12/15/23 expiry

\-1000 365calls 12/15/23 expiry

\+6000 400calls 12/15/23 expiry

This trade is called a ratio condor and you would actually be receiving 41 cents for putting on this trade!

As you can see on this heatmap there’s a little risk if you head towards your upper strike at expiration.

While this one has more risk it has an incredible 29860% return!!!!!!!

&#x200B;

![img](l89vuxf3j1wa1 ""

Now we can build one with a wider landing mark or even less risk….our AI system does all the heavy work, all you need to do is ask",2023-04-25

Thank god I was able to make some money trading , doubling short possitiong and recovery on the little falls. But I defetenly speacted more from all this fucking stress at least to compensate all the money I have spend on ecitalopram and clonazepan . At this point red futures means shit to me, market probably os going to green by open and NVDA and LULU may be up 2% tomorrow even if RSI is above 80. This market is so fucking stupid that make me a rock with no feeling,  im like a fucking robot now. Night before sleep I register my buy and selling ordes my short and calls for next day.

"The most crucial topic this week will involve corporate reports. Who are the leaders, and who are the laggards?",2023-04-17
"Below, I'm offering up the sectors that I believe have the greatest potential for improved financial performance, as well as those that may disappoint investors.

I expect an increase in financial performance in the following areas:

1️⃣ Technology: Primarily, companies specializing in AI and hardware production.

▪ **Nvidia (NVDA)** graphics cards remain highly popular among users, while **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)** and **Intel (INTC)** may also signal a recovery in demand. AI product creators **Alphabet (GOOG)** and **Microsoft (MSFT)** could also see increased demand for their products in the coming quarters, boosting profits.

2️⃣ Cryptocurrency companies: Rising prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other coins are likely to boost profits from commissions for the **Coinbase** crypto exchange **(COIN)** and from the mining company **Marathon Digital (MARA)**.

3️⃣ Energy and precious metals mining:

▪ Mineral prices (gold and silver) exhibited a growth trend in the reporting quarter. This could send profits for **Newmont (NEM)** and **Barrick Gold (GOLD)** soaring.

▪ Increasing energy demand could result in higher revenues for **Peabody Energy (BTU)** and **Arch Resources (ARCH)**.

Laggards:

1️⃣ Financial: Tightening credit conditions and deposit outflows are likely to primarily impact regional banks such as **First Republic Bank (FRC)**. Large banks, including those with investment banking divisions like **Bank of America (BAC)** and **JP Morgan (JPM)**, could benefit from deposit inflows and increased asset values in the stock market. However, the quality of their loan portfolios is deteriorating, and reserves are growing.

I'm not ready to add these shares to my portfolios, so I will continue to observe the dynamics of these stocks.

Additionally, the reports from **Wells Fargo (WFC)**, JP Morgan Chase, and **Citigroup (C)** showed decent results thanks to cost control and growth in net interest income.

2️⃣ Consumer: Stores, including online marketplaces, typically experience a decline in demand in the 1st quarter following holiday sales. I anticipate a drop in demand indicators from **Best Buy (BBY)**, **Walmart (WMT)**, **GAP (GPS)**, as well as a company with ""bath"" in its name that can't be mentioned here since its market cap is now lower than $500 million and faces bankruptcy.

3️⃣ Healthcare: The coronavirus pandemic and seasonal colds have subsided, and the increased demand for drugs has dwindled. Medical companies such as **Teva (TEVA)**, **Pfizer (PFE)**, and **Novavax (NVAX)** could increase spending on new drugs, which would impact shareholder returns negatively.

Conclusion:

Adding a sector to one list or another doesn't necessarily mean that after the report is presented, all of the stocks in promising sectors will soar while all of those in the laggard category will tank. Rather, these are thoughts on on the medium- and long-term growth prospects of specific sectors in my field of vision.

NVDA in Shambles,2023-04-08
"Similar to tech stocks such as AAPL, MSFT, etc, NVDA is also reaching its long-awaited resistance zone around $277 - $280 and the last time this occurred was in November of 2021 before it faced a 3-month massacre.  


With earnings in about a month and a half, we more than likely will see either a small double top and/or retest before slowly seeing it drift off into a short-term bearish habitat. From there, it will be in the hands of Jensen Huang to showcase the performance of his company on May 24th.

"Yes. Hello dumdum, this is Patrick.",2023-04-07
Trading Themes for Q4,2023-04-06
"# Bearish:

**Oil:** OPEC cuts + China reopening + summer demand. This is inflationary and will impact all inflation inputs with the greatest impact being on the more volatile food and energy. Oil going up means higher for longer will be even higher and even longer. If somehow we avoid a recession, the price is going up as prices are somewhat muted currently over fears of a slowdown. Bearish for the market, bullish for oil stocks and dividends. VOC, DVN, ET, BTU - stocks like these are probably the best places to hide in the most bearish of economic outcomes. Someday the US needs to refill, a floor has been established at their price point.

**Rates and QT:** Central banks all have been and are committed to new rake hikes. Higher for longer is the global theme. Remember when Powell said it was transitory and did nothing for six months? He was late to pivot hawkish. He will be late to pivot dovish. It’s pretty clear he’s going to kill inflation or get fired trying. “The effects of stopping too soon are greater than stopping too late.” Short profitless growth with puts as most should retrace at least some or all of their 2023 gains.

**Banks** are seeing record withdrawals, please learn to read and understand the charts correctly. Less money in banks means less loans, less projects, tighter lending criteria. Less liquidity, more realized losses. The biggest shorts in the markets are banks - they are dead in the water, with a limited time one year get out of jail free card from the fed. Hundreds of reputable banks would implode if that facility was removed, and the only way they survive is if the facility is extended or rates get cut drastically. Short the sector ETFs - not sure buying puts here would work out given the IV and elevated premiums.

**Commercial Real Estate** could be the next economic issue to have a material impact on stocks being in essentially the same situation as the banks. REITs are getting withdrawal requests and putting pressure on selling assets to fulfill them. Debt positions must be closed, and refinancing is not attractive. Compounding this is the pandemic likely had a permanent negative impact on the price/value of commercial/office space globally. The debt tied to these assets must be unwound and this means more realized losses. Blackrock, the same entity WSB complains about buying up residential housing, is now halting withdrawals and unwinding things by a de facto margin call from its customers. If you want to be short real estate, you have to look for commercial specific trades as residential real estate is not facing this debt burden or supply/demand problem.

**Unemployment** cracks are starting to form. The data from q1 showed firms drastically slowed hiring by virtue of less job openings- this is the other side of the labor market, the open positions. If the trend continues, this means salaries stop being bid up, more people struggle to find new jobs. Less employed, chasing less salaries, means less liquidity/savings/bank deposits/stock purchases. Puts on profitless growth (selling calls would have higher expected value). Powell is requesting a 1 percent rise in unemployment, be bearish until he gets it.

**Earnings** are an unknown but when reviewing leading indicators weaker earnings are widely expected. A slowing consumer, rising interest costs, means less earnings at the bottom line. The PE ratios of many companies are disconnected from “reality” and the SP is overvalued historically.

**Geopolitical** environment is terrible and getting worse in terms of conflict. US political and social climate is getting worse in terms of conflict.

**All of the above is recessionary** and aligns with historical precedence of the capitalist boom-bust economic cycle.

# Neutral:

**This is a controlled demolition** \- the fed, the us, the eu, the oil cartels, the Chinese do not want a financial crisis nor do they want hyper inflation. “They” will do anything to avoid a total “collapse” and have magic fiscal and monetary policies to extend the problems into the future or make the tax paying population slightly more poor.

**Stagflation** is a very real potential outcome for the economy and for stocks performance. If the financial engineering works, but the asset bubble(s) pop financial assets will go sideways - like Japan. Instead of paying in dollars, we pay in time.

# Bullish:

**The new fed facility** saved the banks. This is not the same money printer or QE, but the net effect lowered 2 year yields and supported tech stocks. There is more room on this facility.

**The new 40 year mortgage.** This simply makes getting debt financing easier. More liquidity, some level of easing is applied specifically to the housing market. This is inflationary however and will only bid up residential housing demand further.

**Financial engineering**. As the reserve currency, politicians and the fed can engineer their way out of almost any problem. New banking facility, changing rates, QE, 40 year mortgages, tax credits, student loan forgiveness, UBI, and anything else they can come up with that we haven’t yet imagined.

**AI** is going to going to be disruptive, but if there was any time to use the excuse of “priced in” it is on the AI trend. If you haven’t spent 30 minutes interfacing with chatgpt you are likely missing a technological leap the scale of the computer, the internet, the mobile phone. Even if you don’t want to invest in the trend, invest in your understanding of chatgpt for your own skillset if you want to win. Calls and shares at “the bottom” on a basket of the best names in AI: MSFT, NVDA, GOOG and some small/mid cap stocks.

**The USD** won’t be replaced anytime soon certainly not in this economic cycle - the US and our military would essentially need to “default on its obligations” before the globe would stop investing in USD in favor of something else. No other country or group of countries is remotely as stable, trustworthy, powerful as the US. However the strength of the contender may continue to grow - watch Ray Dalio video on YouTube which explains this.

**Everyone is bearish** and professional sentiment is low, but stocks only go up. This is the BTFD generation, and the most average humans I know still have money to throw at assets. Institutional investors are positioned bearish, and sitting on high proportions of cash waiting to be deployed. The party is not over just yet.

>TL;DR: I’m bullish on AI and the US market. I think everyone is overly bearish, stocks only go up, and central banks will print their way out of any problem. Don’t be a sucker. Be bearish if you want to make money trading oil or shorting the banks/commercial real estate/REITs.",2023-04-06

Are you buying a round at your local Wendy's dumpster?,2023-04-05
NVO has majority market share for obesity care which has TAM 50x from current market. Why are calls so cheap ? 20k YOLO inside,2023-04-03
"I'm gonna keep this short and simple with a lot of pictures coz I think this is a good opportunity to make money so gather around.

It's been well documented how [life expectancy](https://irp.nih.gov/blog/post/2020/01/extreme-obesity-shaves-years-off-life-expectancy) drops dramatically with obesity. GLP-1 drugs, used for some time in [diabetes](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/managing-your-diabetes/treating-your-diabetes/tablets-and-medication/incretin-mimetics) treatment, have recently been approved [in the US](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-drug-treatment-chronic-weight-management-first-2014) for obesity care. Do your own DD but this really seems like the silver bullet to obesity that drug companies have been looking for. Side effects include severe nausea and, rarely, pancreatitis and thyroid cancer, but this drug is extremely [effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9063254/) at delivering weight loss.

NVO currently has over 50% market share from obesity care fwiw

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Per NVO only 2&#37; of people with obesity are in medical treatment, TAM 50X from here](https://preview.redd.it/f2l8j4572pra1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8022c4f390eebe2ec3aa1a3181243fa130b38ac3)

[Obesity care is only 9&#37; of NVO's business](https://preview.redd.it/1ailzwad2pra1.png?width=1381&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47d700aea18b21e7c42361f6e6746309b0d81e71)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[NVO Obesity Care grew 84&#37; last year](https://preview.redd.it/ynr28hgq1pra1.png?width=689&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b7117663f4bfb9621393ae44e29445e242b5eeaf)

But grew 84% last year

&#x200B;

[Overall financial performance is ipressive](https://preview.redd.it/lz5fshgu1pra1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1ff8a571090b1ecab16669dfe4f3a258d70c7945)

&#x200B;

[Why are leaps so cheap ?](https://preview.redd.it/79rpi6yo3pra1.png?width=1137&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=102c4b1d03699f395a05899b0164c83da63300bd)

&#x200B;

[Current positions](https://preview.redd.it/66jq2ewq3pra1.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e83461fcc704dc9006f7af7d30fd828e20cc8256)

&#x200B;

I really don't know what a fair value for these leaps is, but I think at least 5X up from here. At some point market is going to start pricing NVO closer to TAM valuation of 50X their obesity care, which at 9% current business implies a 450% growth from here. Their current p/e of 44 is high, but unlike NVDA, TSLA, and all the other nosebleed valuations which are predicated on hopes and dreams, this drug is real and it is only a matter of scaling it up.

The leaps on this chain are too cheap",2023-04-03

Went long QQQ calls today. I feel very dirty.,2023-03-30
"I had to hold my nose and buy some QQQ calls.  The world cental banks injected $1 Trillion in liquidity and if I have learned something over the decades of trading, do not fight the Fed.  While I am confidant that the world is not saved, as is evident from my CRE post, I also remember 2008 when Bear Stearns went belly up in March but it took the summer and part of the Fall until Lehman went under.  Of course, the DOJ also sued two of Bear's hedge funds in August so that helped.  The chance of the DOJ suing any investment bank or bank this time around is 1%.  I mean, they just backstopped them, again.

**Other contributing factors to my QQQ long position:**

1. Hedge Funds and CTA's are still overwhelmingly bearish according to multiple reports from Government Sachs, the devil (JPM) and others.
2. QQQ is in a technical bull market now.  I don't argue with charts.
3. There's still that $1 trillion I mentioned up above that is supposed to stabilize deposit bases.  And after 2008 the largest banks who received their bailouts, promised to lend that money out.  They didn't - they put it in risk assets - stocks.  But sure, this time they will do as they say.
4. Hedgies are short overwhelmingly, to the tune of $28 billion SPX futures that they need to cover in April.
5. Seasonality as shown by the attached graphic.
6. Perfect conditions for a short squeeze on the NDX which is nowhere near overbought.

**HOWEVER, there are just as many worrisome data points:**

1. Since Dec 28, 50% of the gain in NDX has been from 5 stocks NVDA, AAPL, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA META.  Sorry, that's very.  See #2
2. From the graphic, earnings are now expected to drop 12% yoy from last year.  Not good if you are a fundamental investor.
3. There WILL be more bad news from the banking sector.  Might be a private HF or private REIT, but this is a no brainer.
4. The Fed apparently only really wanted to get the market through the end of this quarter bc how much news have you heard from them about regulatory enforcement?  NONE.  Why? Because if they hadn't, can you freaking imagine what some of these large banks would be reporting.
5. EOQ is the time for mutual funds and all to ""paint the tape.""  They sell the stocks that have rec'd bad press (banks) and buy the stocks that have rec'd good press (NVDA et al.)  Translation: HF chasing over the last 3 weeks has led to the NDX advance which has held the SPX up.
6. If the tech sector is so hot, then why have so many LARGE layoffs been announced?  And the layoffs are broad: META  -11,000; GOOGL - 12,0000; AMZN-distribution labor - 9000; Indeed - 2200 - uhm, job search site, WMT-layoffs from warehouse to distribution.  And then the one I think is hilarious are the 1400 from McKinsey and Co -who are usually the ones doing the layoffs.

BTW, perhaps the easiest metric to use to know if the NDX run is over?  AAPL.  Pull up a chart.  Lately its been leading the market.

Finally, despite being ""forced"" into a long QQQ position, I also put on a long VIX position today.  I mean, cmon - look at the daily chart.

I hate it, I think its a joke, but I will not fight the Fed.  I hope the market elevates so I can get short at higher levels. I remain short CMBS, COIN, and CLX.  Long VIX and other ""story"" plays.

Thanks.

time to short the absolute fuck out of NVDA - P/E of 120 with stalled revenue and declining earnings growth,2023-03-22
"Looking at the financials of this company over the past 4 years:

1. P/E of 120
2. Revenue is slowly growing (8% a year) BUT...
3. declining earnings growth (**-19% a year**)
4. Dependent on the Auto industry which has seen a slight decline is sales
5. They sell a non-unique commodity that can be easily substituted by other competitors
6. They dumped all their money into US Treasuries, corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities which has tanked their porfolio
7. Auto buyers are looking at more economical options with a looming recession and economic slowdown, lowering the insurance premiums paid by each customer.

Oh wait, shit, i'm talking about an insurance company, **Progressive Corporation (PGR)**, not a tech company like NVDA which actually has a shot at growing into their P/E potential.

fuck it, I was shorting NVDA as well.

🚀🌕 NVDA: Crypto Slump Ain't Holding Us Back – Gaming Revenues Ready to Blast Off! 💥🎮,2023-03-19
"Greetings, fellow degenerates! Buckle up, because it's time to talk about a stock that's primed for some explosive gains. 

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), the unstoppable GPU powerhouse that's about to see gaming revenues skyrocket, despite the hurting crypto industry.

Crypto Who? 🤔
While it's true that NVIDIA has dipped its toes into the crypto waters with their Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) product line, don't let the current crypto slump fool you. In Q1 2021, CMP sales accounted for only $155 million, about 2.74% of NVIDIA's total revenue of $5.66 billion. That's peanuts compared to their gaming segment, which brought in a whopping $2.76 billion or 49% of the total revenue. So even if the crypto industry takes a hit, NVDA's bottom line remains resilient, and they're ready to dominate the gaming market.

Gaming Revenues: Ready for Lift-off 🚀
In the past five years, NVIDIA has seen a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20%, and with a new generation of gaming consoles and blockbuster games hitting the shelves, the demand for high-performance GPUs is about to skyrocket. NVIDIA's GeForce GPUs are gamers' top choice, and we all know that the gaming market is booming. Global gaming industry revenue is projected to reach $196 billion by 2022, up from $159.3 billion in 2020. As more people turn to gaming for entertainment, NVIDIA is poised to reap the rewards, translating into juicy gains for us degenerate apes.

Cloud Gaming: The Next Frontier 🌌
Cloud gaming is gaining traction, and NVIDIA is already ahead of the game with its GeForce NOW platform. The cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48.2% from 2021 to 2028, reaching $7.24 billion by 2028. As more gamers shift to cloud gaming, NVIDIA's gaming revenues will further soar, making the crypto industry's struggles look like a minor speed bump on the road to the moon.

So, fellow degenerates, strap in and prepare for takeoff, because NVDA is ready to show the world that the gaming industry's gains will overshadow any crypto woes. Remember, this ain't financial advice, and always do your own research. But don't be surprised if we're all partying on the moon with our sweet, sweet NVDA tendies. 🌕🍗",2023-03-19

NVDIA Short Trade Setup,2023-03-23
"Hello Traders, here is a trade setup for NVIDIA.

NVDA is extremely over extended to the upside and could potentially be one of the best shorts of the year.

* Entry - $275 (Major trendline hit)
* Exit #1 - $230 (Support - potential bounce from this level)

You can take profits wherever you see fit, however ultimately I believe semi's will get crushed in the coming months and we could potentially see NVDA easily do a .5% retrace back to $191.

Nasdaq leads Wall Street rally as hopes of Fed rate-hike pause grow,2023-03-23
"Mainly rate-sensitive technology and growth stocks rose after the Federal Reserve signaled an imminent pause in rate hikes amid turmoil in the banking sector, with the Nasdaq leading Wall Street's main indexes higher.

&#x200B;

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Amazon. STARQ: AMZN ) were each up about 2% on Thursday.

&#x200B;

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) shares rose 3.3% after Needham raised its price target on the chipmaker, citing the company's potential to benefit from recent data center strength.

&#x200B;

Communication services and technology stocks led gains in the S&P 500 .

&#x200B;

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, but its policy statement stopped saying ""continued rate hikes"" might be appropriate, marking a marked shift in its stance.

&#x200B;

The Fed's dovish tone has eased markets that have been roiled by concerns about a liquidity crisis in the banking sector since the collapse of two regional U.S. banks earlier this month.

&#x200B;

""The market is hoping that you might have one more hike,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.

&#x200B;

""I can imagine hopes (for a rate cut) being dashed. You don't want things to get to the point where you need to cut rates.""

&#x200B;

According to CME Group's (NASDAQ: CME ) Fedwatch tool, traders' bets are almost evenly split between a 25-basis-point pause and another hike in May.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, troubled regional lender First Republic (NYSE: FRC ) fell 6%, and was in volatile trade after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said there was no discussion of insuring all bank deposits. Extend the decline.

&#x200B;

However, Peers Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) Corp and Western Alliance (NYSE:WAL) Bancorp rose 2.1% and 4.4%, respectively.

&#x200B;

Data showed initial jobless claims fell to 191,000 last week from the previous week, compared with expectations for a rise to 197,000.

&#x200B;

Globally, the Bank of England raised interest rates by a further 25 percentage points and predicted that the surge in UK inflation would cool faster than before.

&#x200B;

At 12:07 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 398.52 points, or 1.24%, to 32,428.63, the S&P 500 was up 59.20 points, or 1.50%, to 3,996.17 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 251.34 points, or 2.15 percent to 11,921.30.

&#x200B;

Block Inc fell 12.8 percent after Hindenburg Research said it had a short position in the Jack Dorsey-led payments company.

&#x200B;

Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN ) Global Inc fell 11.1% after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission threatened to sue the cryptocurrency exchange over some of its products.

&#x200B;

Accenture (NYSE: ACN ) rose 7.7 percent after it planned to cut about 2.5 percent of its workforce.

&#x200B;

Advancers outnumbered decliners by a 3.08-to-1 ratio on the New York Stock Exchange and a 2.01-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

&#x200B;

The S&P posted four new 52-week highs and 10 new lows, while the Nasdaq posted 42 new highs and 130 new lows.",2023-03-23

What is About to Happen,2023-03-21
" How many of these do you think I will be correct on? 

**BTC and related stocks (Coin, Riot)** \- it rallies for the same reason the bank stocks failed. People afraid for the deposits so they pull them and buy bitcoin. The tech bros of SF got their money out of SVB and bought BTC. The retail dummies who think the bottom is in continue to speculate on bitcoin. This is the exact type of speculation Powell and the fed want to crush. All it takes is a break in confidence, like FTX, and the house of cards will come down again. FTX and Silvergate will not be the only casualties of this tightening cycle. If the globe wants anyone to lose, or anyone to destroy capital in the name of deflation, it is the crypto boys. They need to donate to the game and from the Feds perspective, they have no right to keep their “deposits” out of the existing financial system. 

**Powell** \- 25 bps hike is all but guaranteed. No hike means he is scared and the contagion in the banks is bigger than the contagion he was previously fighting: inflation. A 50 bps hike would imply he is blind to the data and actually wants the banking system to implode. Realize the bonds banks have been holding, that they just created a new facility to support, would be weakened even further with a bigger rate hike. Try to crush inflation and you crush the banks. Support the banks and you support inflation. 25bps is the compromise and is inline with the recent fed speak. They need to fight both battles and 25bps is the path of least resistance. 

**QQQ** \- has been rallying because it does not have exposure to regional banks. The market thinks that mega cap tech has the best balance sheets and so they go hide their money there thinking they are getting growth at a reasonable price. Tech also rallied because of the historic drop in yields. All three of these forces are now reversing. Banks are backstopped, yields are trending up again, and the fed is about to raise again. Any and all profitless tech has more room to fall and QQQ will fall in unison with this move even if megacaps can hang on. 

**NVDA and MSFT** \- AI mega-trend is too big to ignore, but it doesn’t all have to happen in 6 months. The market has brought forward 2-3 years of AI revenue growth and priced it into NVDA today. Just keep in mind the blockchain revolution, 3d printing, solar stocks, full self driving, IoT, weed stocks and everything else “revolutionary” that has appeared in the past 10 years of cheap money. Have any lived up to their real world promises? AI is no joke and will likely have a tremendous impact, but no need to pay for the next 3 years of impact today. If NVDA or MSFT don’t deliver on perfection, and actually exceed it, these valuations are not sustainable - especially for NVDA. If you can buy and hold for a longer duration you will probably do fine, but it could be sideways/down the next several years as the reality catches up with the hype. Look to short the small caps riding this wave C3AI, NET etc 

**2yr Yields** \- if you are not watching these historic movements, you are missing the most important alternative to investing in stocks. I predict the recent collapse in yields was due to the fed, and others, buying up bonds because either the banks were dumping their bags or the market was thinking “the fed is done.” The problem is that the fed can’t be done with inflation at these levels. If the fed was really done, they would have let the banks implode as that would have immediately crushed inflation and kickstarted a meaningful recession/depression rather rapidly. Instead, they backstopped the banks so they can slow burn the economy down to their inflation targets. Fed will continue to raise, bonds will continue to be an attractive alternative, tech stocks future cashflows will get discounted further. The 2yr yield should represent the “discount rate” used by algos and institution traders and you should expect it to continue to rise and tech stocks continue to fall. 

**Energy** \- the winner from 2022 has been lagging in 2023 but expect that trend to reverse. Energy, and oil specifically, are probably the best hedge against inflation and against a recession. Everything, I repeat everything, requires fossil fuels to operate in our modern economy and “green anything” is not an alternative to the laws of physics. Expect oil to continue to rise as US refills Strategic Reserves, China reopens, the war persists, and OPEC to continue to cut production. Oil and the dividend stocks should be the place to hide for the next leg down - and will likely out perform in a world of stagflation/sideways action. Remember the price of oil caused the major inflationary event in the US. 

**Stagflation** \- I am becoming more and more convinced that 1) we will not have an economic collapse because everything is manipulated and orchestrated by the fed’s printer and we still have several print your way out of jail cards remaining. 2) we will not have another bull market because valuations are already extended and there is a GLOBAL inflation problem. A bull market that is simply driven by inflation will not make any of us more wealthy as the purchasing power of the USD will erode faster than asset prices can increase. The path of least resistance is going sideways like Japan, kicking the can down the road, and suffering 1000 paper cuts rather than cutting off a leg like we should have done in 08 and like we should have done in 22. Instead of taking the pain all at once, we will slowly debase the currency as suffer a slow painful decline felt most by the poor. 

**QE5/Easing -** The money printer is not on, the fed is not deliberately easing. Yes, they bought bonds, yes they took the bags from the banks, yes this depressed yields and otherwise eased conditions - but do not take this as a pivot. You have to hear those words from the man himself (maybe tomorrow?) but the new facility set up for the banks will not inject new money supply into the markets. It will not find its way into the hands of new borrowers. No new credit is being created and it will not impact the real economy or inflation - that is why the Fed was able to do it.

It's everything, all at once, everywhere because everyone has been doing stupid shit for goddamn decades.   


This will be equally hilarious and frightening, the depth of the crisis that will unfold. There is nothing anyone can do about it because the people in charge are the same ones that created the feedback loop in the first place.

### Definitions:

* **Historical Move**: in the past 4 weeks what is the historical volatility (up and down, log variance of daily gains).
* **Priced Move**: given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Strikes**: The at the money strike.
* **Expiration**: 4 weeks away.
* **Call/Put Premium**: how much extra you are paying for the expected move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean they are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean they are ""expensive.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid to qualify for this strategy.

"\[U.S. Stock Market\].

&#x200B;

Last week's market trend was basically expected, after several days of sharp declines U.S. stocks began to rebound to repair, still less affected by the \[$ NASDAQ Composite Index (.IXIC.US)$\] led the way, with a weekly gain of 4.41%, the \[$ [DJI.US](https://DJI.US))$\] continues to be mired in the bankruptcy fiasco, closing down 0.15%. The pattern of U.S. stocks is clear, the Dow resisted last year, hovering at a high level for a long time, and now the situation is reversed, there is no need to resist any longer, simply do free fall, do not expect the Dow to stop falling for a while, the low of 28660 last year is not without the possibility of being penetrated.

&#x200B;

From the morphology of the Dow may do a downward relay after the possibility of going straight to last year's low

&#x200B;

As for the Nasdaq, although the technology stocks led to protect the plate, especially \[$ Nvidia ([NVDA.US](https://NVDA.US))$\] and \[$ Microsoft ([MSFT.US](https://MSFT.US))$\] two Chatgpt true leader, can continue to rise against the trend, but just like Microsoft can not protect the Dow, led by Nvidia alone, a number of technology stocks may not be able to move the Nasdaq, because $ Tesla ([TSLA.US](https://TSLA.US))$ recent performance is very low. It can be said that the divergence of the long side in this position of the Nasdaq is not small, so I have repeatedly stressed that the recent trend of U.S. stocks is volatile, there is no sustainability, you can not put a heavy position to bet on one side, either to do a good job of hedging, or control the position to do a single side, but to grasp the timing of entry and exit, which is the so-called ""look short to do short"".

&#x200B;

The main reason why the U.S. stocks can't look too long is the bank liquidity crisis kill power in the end how big? The retailer is lack of vigilance, yesterday \[$ Silicon Valley Bank ([SIVB.US](https://SIVB.US))$\] today \[$ First Republic Bank ([FRC.US](https://FRC.US))$\] tomorrow \[$ Credit Suisse ([CS.US](https://CS.US))$\], thunderstorms after thunderstorms, overwhelmed, but many people will be seen as a heavenly opportunity to open the casino, busy plunging everywhere, so that vigilance from where to talk about it. If the problem can be solved in a week or two, what is it called a financial crisis. Be prepared for a long struggle ......

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Today I read a rumor that European and American banks continue to thunder, the credibility of the ground, many funds have flowed into Hong Kong Island, the text is full of words, what relatives' sons work in the bank, recently busy sucking up even vacation, and then shout a bunch of slogans for the benefit of the country and the people to increase credibility. Why would someone package the liquidity crisis of European and American banks as a major boon to Hong Kong stocks? What is the point of such self-deception and self-anesthesia? The more the crisis, the more sober it should be! The stock market is not supposed to compete with the short and long of the moment, at any time should follow the trend, to preserve the capital to have the opportunity to turn around in the future, the end of the matter of passion only their own victims, the market will not have the slightest mercy.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 77%. (Stats as of 2023-02-28)",2023-03-18
