0,CVNA Stock Primed for a Short Squeeze,"
Greetings, fellow Regards. I've done some DD on Carvana Co (CVNA) and I'm here to share some findings that suggest an impending short squeeze scenario.

Explosive Options Volume: Today, CVNA options have witnessed an extraordinary surge in volume, with a whopping 112,832 contracts traded so far. This accounts for approximately 11.3 million underlying shares, a significant 48.5% of CVNA's average daily trading volume over the past month.

$15 Strike Call Option: June 02, 2023 The call option for the $15 strike is attracting substantial attention, with 17,210 contracts traded today, representing around 1.7 million underlying shares of CVNA. This heightened interest suggests a potential bullish sentiment among investors.

Strategic National Ad Campaign: Carvana is making strategic moves to amplify its market presence. They have recently launched a national ad campaign that showcases glowing five-star reviews from satisfied customers. This offensive push demonstrates their determination to rebound from previous spending cuts and enhance their bottom line.

Profitability in Sight: CVNA's first-quarter earnings report indicated their expectation of achieving adjusted EBITDA profitability in the current quarter. The initiation of the new ad campaign further strengthens the belief that they are well on their way to realizing this goal.

Volume Surpassing Average: Today's trading volume has surpassed the three-month average even before noon. This surge could be an indication of short sellers scrambling to cover their positions by repurchasing shares, potentially fueling a short squeeze.

Bright Prospects in Asset-Backed Security Market: CVNA stands to benefit from an improving asset-backed security market. This positive market trend has the potential to substantially boost the company's EBITDA in the second quarter, leading to exciting growth prospects.

Bill Gates' Backing: Bill Gates is holding a 5 million dollar bag. 

Considering these compelling factors, it becomes increasingly likely that CVNA is poised for a short squeeze. keep a close eye.

3,👀,"Corporate price hikes get the side-eye as #greedflation trends, stoking the inflate debate

More heated than the “Succession” finale… the greedflation debate. With inflation still stubbornly high, some are pointing fingers at corporate profits. The idea, also dubbed profit-led inflation or “excuseflation,” is that some corporations hike prices beyond what's needed to cover rising costs — leaning on broad inflation and black-swan events (like: pandemic, war) as an excuse. In a recent survey of 2K US consumers, over half said they believe greedflation is happening “a lot.” They’re not alone.

Makin’ bank: European Central Bank economists said that businesses have been padding profits, which they argued was a bigger inflation driver than rising wages in the second half of last year.

Corporate profit margins hit a 70-year high last year as consumers stomached higher prices, and this year companies continued flexing their “pricing power.”

Not everyone's on team #greedflation… While some margin-padding may be happening, many economists say there’s little evidence that corporate profits are significant contributors to inflation. Last week, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke and ex-IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard released a study that pointed to Covid supply shocks (and the trillions in gov’t stimulus that followed) as the main causes of US pandemic-era inflation. Picture: fewer goods available + more $$ to buy them with. Last year, Treasury Secretary Yellen rejected the idea that corporate greed is driving inflation, pointing to good-old supply and demand as the main culprit.
THE TAKEAWAY
The “greedflation” debate is a symptom… of unusually resilient demand. US consumer spending jumped last month and inflation accelerated. Despite its aggressive interest-rate hikes, the Fed hasn’t been able to cool demand/inflation/the labor market nearly as fast as hoped. Without continued spending, prices wouldn’t have been able to stay so elevated. Resilient demand could be a result of extraordinary stimulus measures and years of near-zero rates that helped lead to historically low unemployment and rising wages. But some retailers are starting to see that consumers are tightening their budgets.",1685479391.0,0,2023-05-30
4,"When will tech join the sell off? 5-30-23 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ, VIX, 10YR Yield/ DXY Daily Market Analysis","Its actually really interesting the fact that some of these big tech companies are rallying 3-6% intraday while SPY continues to struggle… they literally are just passing the buck around until the hat finally breaks. 

We once again find ourselves in a familiar situation… a NYSE and S&p500 lead sell off into power hour without the support of tech.. followed by a coordinated TECH and VIX sell off EOD to prevent the full sell off potential… we have yet to truly see a day where tech leads the sell off and we have also yet to see a sell off that is allowed to continue into EOD.

Honestly what I hate the most is that you cant really say this rally is fake because well its actually happening right in front of our eyes… but what we can say is that this rally isn’t as strong and isn’t as sustainable as some want us to believe. 

**DEBT CEILING** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oi4b1q1e513b1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=63d182bacf16e29f6194d20b270da67a0bb16d24

So now something I found EXTREMELY interesting and you know ill be first to admit that when it comes to stuff like this im very uneducated and just don’t understand the interworkings… but something one of the speakers said today is that basically due to the expected revenue in June that the actual debt limit and “running out of money” in June was overblown and incorrect in timing… I found that interesting… 

Now the whole thing that really matters here is that my understanding is that the vote for this debt ceiling will happen tomorrow (I tried to find a time and couldn’t find any officially listed)… however, as of right now IF these people stick to what they are saying then we actually will end up with a default. The last “official” default date I heard was june 5th. So theyd have 4 days to basically scramble and get it done… popcorn event Thursday and Friday? 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aagmcfke513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7ddd0a535dbe92ac524c68c88bb1fb5f54c17339

We did not establish a new supply today, however, we did set ourselves up put a new daily supply in tomorrow… In doing that we actually would take our 419.5 and 418.78 supplies and would put our new upside resistance and supply at 422.08.

Now we are in extremely weekly momentum so one could expect a bounce off the supply and push higher which would then establish a new demand somewhere in this 417-419 area. However, IF the debt ceiling news shakes the market enough we could see a bigger push down to 414.55 demand or even 410.2 demand (support) to retest that support first. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/idw7561f513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=81711666c3e27c5c78a4855d58e95578c54f58fa

When we look at the daily honestly this pattern of breaking out and rejecting the upside reminds me a lot of April 4th/18th and May 1st/ 19th. This structure actually looks pretty identical to May 18th and 19th. If so then we should see a rejection and actually see a retrace back to at least the daily 8 if not 20ema.

That gives us a price target of 414.5 to 416.8 for our retrace…

Now in the off chance that we continue to move higher and hold this black bull channel (which support is at 420.3 which means spy has to open green and hold green all day tomorrow)… if we hold that then our upside target is 425.78. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 418.78 -> 419.5 -> 429.68  
 Demand- 414.55 -> 410.2  
 Support- 420.2 -> 418.6 -> 417 -> 415.3  
 Resistance- 422.1 -> 425.1

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/17crlfif513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=97ba7b9ca02062d9b7a714c43b1c3778ac0af84f

On Futures it’s the same thing we did not make a new supply and actually the daily DMI on futures shows a little bit more upside to go.

Looking at this until a new supply (resistance) is officially put in this likely is a backtest and bounce off the 4209/4215 supply. However, if a red day is put in tomorrow we likely turn 4240 into a new supply which would take our 4209/4215 and that would then target a breakdown to 4156 and possible 4128 on a bigger sell off. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/12vg9uxf513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a70d0c2021fff34450671510996f4f00df9dd01e

Futures remains in its black bull channel which has a much more generous support at 4180 for tomorrow and resistance at 4261. A retest of the daily 8ema would give us a bounce near 4200 again tomorrow. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4209 -> 4215 -> 4312  
 Demand- 4156 -> 4128  
 Support- 4215 -> 4189 -> 4156  
 Resistance- 4240 -> 4260

**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/atnz9ofg513b1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=43af14edc955a951652bdd0e04774cb9f6288a99

Now on QQQ I actually really am looking for a retrace tomorrow… the daily DMI has hit overbought, and we are nearing a new supply being put in… we did come up and take our 351.57 demand today also. 

If we put a new supply in tomorrow at 352.68 then our targets would be 347.11 and potentially 337.6 if we see a bigger drop. 

However, there is a case to be made here if this keeps running that we reach 357.09 and 361.7 demand to take that demand out before we retrace. 

Honestly, from a technical stand point QQQ is so over extended it needs a pullback if bulls want any hope at 350-360s… 

The red bull support sits at 350.7 and resistance at 360 for tomorrow. 

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y7cjs7tg513b1.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=76efddb51999a4056dfcd66af09e0e956d7a9fb5

Now on the VIX we came within a few pennies of hitting that key 16.92 support before we bounced… for a while today we attempted to and intended to break back over 17.97 and hold it. However, the EOD push up on SPY was met and led by a nice VIX drop… this doji here on VIX could with the potential SPY rejection signal a nice upside VIX and downside SPY move tomorrow. 

Today was also an anomaly in that the VIX and SPY both closed green today… 

**10YR YIELD and DXY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t7aday7h513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1cb6909c7455d5f7120104481f1e474dcb979bb2

Now one thing that is very interesting to me here is the fact that DXY broke its almost month long bull channel support. However, it is holding that key 103.865 support. But with momentum to the upside breaking on DXY that actually could favor upside on SPY… the one interesting thing really is the fact that DXY rallied WITH SPY over the last month… 

The 10YR has the same trend in that it officially broke its uptrend with a rejection off of 3.813%... the key support to watch will be 3.693%.. now with the DXY I cant really wrap my head around why SPY would rally with it and drop with it… but on 10YR one could say that the 10YR rallying with SPY would be people going RISKY on and then a rejection here would be people going risk off.

This weekend I spent almost a whole half day going through all of my trades over the last month and identifying what was working and what wasn’t working the best… I came out super excited for my discovery and I did a lot of cleaning up of my charts… in doing that I actually was able to secure a massive win today… put in my full weekly profits today… “Mondays” have been extremely great to me so for the last month or so…

I actually really enjoyed trading today… as you can see there was some struggle in the morning as I kept bitting the recovery that never came (my own fault) and then mid day I struggled with the fake breakdown/ recovery and timing the breakdown… I definitely got stop loss hunted a few times today but overall a great day of trading mentally and results wise too.",1685479201.0,5,2023-05-30

Fed's Barkin: There is more willingness among businesses to try to increase prices, and that will continue until demand falls. FED policy is in restrictive territory, but there is uncertainty around where rates need to go.

Core PCE is not moving fast enough. I feel a July hike is very much on the table now (still think June would be a pause).

Holiday travel spending remains strong. The U.S. screened nearly 9.8 million airline passengers over the four-day holiday weekend, surpassing pre-COVID 2019 levels by 300,000, according to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

As I mentioned a while back, the Federal Reserve has been tightening its balance sheet for a while, while the European Union has just started the quantitative tightening (QT) process. Euro area money supply (M1) dropped 5.2%, reaching a historic low. If the decline continues (which it probably will), the EU zone will enter a recession in the second half of 2023 (Germany is technically already in a recession).

**The Economy**

May's Dallas Fed Manufacturing index fell to -29.1, worse than the estimated -18 and the previous month's -23.4. Notably, new orders, shipments, delivery times, and outlook all declined further, indicating a deeper contraction. Both production and capital expenditures shifted from expansion to contraction. However, like the results shown in other regional surveys, employment experienced a slight increase.

Conference Board consumer confidence declined slightly in May. “Consumer confidence declined in May as consumers’ view of current conditions became somewhat less upbeat while their expectations remained gloomy,” said Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior Director, Economics at The Conference Board. “Their assessment of current employment conditions saw the most significant deterioration, with the proportion of consumers reporting jobs are ‘plentiful’ falling 4 ppts from 47.5 percent in April to 43.5 percent in May.

It's encouraging to see that most coincident economic indicators are holding up well and not signaling an impending recession. However, there are concerns regarding the retail and production sectors, as they have shown some weaknesses.

RBC is the latest to lift year-end target: “.. we are lifting our YE 2023 S&P 500 price target from 4,100 to 4,250 \[and\] lifting our 2023 S&P 500 EPS forecast to $213 from $200 .. the case against US equities relative to non-US equities has been overstated .. and think Small Caps are at an attractive entry point ..”

A great summary of the impact of US government spending on stock/bond performance. Stock tends to perform better when Uncle Sam is out shopping. Bonds tend to be under press as the spending was made on borrowed money.

The rally that followed the re-opening of China's economy has come to an abrupt halt, and certain indices are now nearing bear-market territory.

I have mentioned many times that large growth stocks have had a tremendous year so far, while small and mid-cap stocks have significantly underperformed due to economic uncertainty. However, if the uncertainty begins to settle in the second half of the year, small and mid-cap valuations will become very attractive compared to large growth names.

Many believe that semis are no longer cyclical because everything now requires chips, leading to a constant supply shortage. However, this chart suggests otherwise. If the PMI resumes its decline later this year (if indeed we are heading into a recession), semiconductor stocks will likely face demand shocks.

Tesla to expand its Shanghai Gigafactory to produce 1.75 million cars a year! Also, China will become the #1 market for Tesla this year.** 

Shares of Tesla rose Tuesday after the electric carmaker’s CEO Elon Musk met with China’s Foreign Minister Qin Gang.

It comes as Beijing is pushing to show it is open to foreign business, and as Musk reportedly signaled further expansion of his car company’s business in China.

Qin, who was until recently China’s ambassador to the U.S., said “Chinese-style modernization,” characterized by a huge population and “common prosperity” will create “unprecedented growth potential and market demand,” according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry.

He added that China’s electric vehicle market “has broad prospects for development” and that China will continue to open up and create a better market-oriented and law-based business environment for foreign firms like Tesla.

According to the Chinese foreign ministry statement, Musk praised the Chinese people and China’s achievements. Tesla opposes “decoupling” and is willing to continue to expand its business in China, the statement said.",1685464372.0,23,2023-05-30

24,"Unleashing the Hybrid Cloud AI Revolution: Nvidia's DGX, IBM's Ansible, and the Perfect Storm","Not financial advice!

Nvidia's recent product announcements may provide valuable clues about the future of AI and which companies are best positioned for the value AI will unlock. I'm not personally interested in buying  NVDA at current prices, as its price seems to be close to at least somewhat re-rated to market expectations.  We're early in the game here de-gens and there might be other opportunities worth exploring that are flying under the radar.  It' this regard’s opinion that reading between the lines of Nvidia's new product roadmap, can uncover potential AI benefits that haven't yet been fully reflected in the stock prices of other companies.

So… Nvidia has dropped a big one with its new DGX AI platform. If you're into the tech scene, you know Nvidia is a man amongst boys in the AI space. This DGX thing? It's a beast. Imagine a supercharged AI playground, but it's not just playing around - it's working, and working damn hard.

It's gonna be huge for our cloud bros - Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Google Cloud, IBM, all of 'em. They'll be drooling all over this DGX platform. Why? It's like an AI power-up. Whoever taps into this beast will have their AI game leveled up big time.

But here's where the fun starts. This DGX tech isn't just good for any cloud - it's perfect for the hybrid cloud approach. That's where you mix up your on-premises servers (that's tech talk for the old-school, actual physical stuff) with public cloud services. This hybrid stuff is a big deal for AI because it gives you flexibility, security, and the raw horsepower you need to run high-powered AI applications. And guess who's the hybrid cloud champ? It's our old friend IBM, who's been pushing the hybrid cloud way harder than anyone else.

And how does IBM do it? Enter Ansible. This thing is like the magic wand for setting up and managing hybrid cloud stuff. It's a massive hit with the tech geeks because it's like a cheat code for making complex stuff simple. Ansible lets you stand up new hybrid cloud AI products and services like you're flipping pancakes.

Now, Ansible's part of IBM's tool kit, thanks to their acquisition of Red Hat a while back. IBM + Ansible + hybrid cloud is like the dream team for leveraging Nvidia's DGX platform. While all the cloud providers are gonna want a piece of the DGX pie, IBM is sitting pretty with their hybrid cloud focus and their Ansible magic.

Bottom line: Nvidia's DGX platform is throwing down the gauntlet in the AI game, and it's shouting ""hybrid cloud or bust!"" IBM's sitting in the sweet spot with Ansible and their hybrid cloud game.

IBM’s share value has been mostly stagnant over the past few months.  No AI respect!  No AI respect here at all I tell ya!  When the next year or two’s quarterly numbers come in, the markets will have to take notice.  JMO",1685459327.0,16,2023-05-30

I'm here to present you with a solid bull case for UiPath that'll make you feel like you've hit the motherlode of tendies, ready to feast on gains while we ride this RPA rocket straight to the moon, so that you might finally afford to leave your abusive wifes boyfreind house and move out! (seriously fuck that guy!)

What is Uipath and what do they do?

UiPath, my fellow degenerates, is the absolute king of Robotic Process Automation (RPA)! Their software platform allows companies to automate mundane, repetitive tasks that used to suck the life out of their employees. Think about all those poor office workers buried under piles of paperwork, drowning in manual data entry. Well, UiPath swoops in like a superhero, streamlining processes and freeing up time for the good stuff.

But why is this important, you may ask, ? Well, because companies are obsessed with efficiency, baby! By automating processes with UiPath's cutting-edge technology, businesses can dramatically increase productivity and reduce costs. And you know what that means? Big, fat, juicy profits! More productivity equals more money, and more money means a skyrocketing stock price!

Let's talk numbers, fam. UiPath's revenue growth has been nothing short of mind-blowing. They've been consistently doubling their revenue year over year, and since they are a software only company their margins are insane! currently they have 3x assets sitting on their balance sheets compared to their liabilities, and if that doesn't make your dick tingle, I don't know what will! With a market that's estimated to be worth in the hundreds billions, UiPath has plenty of room to grow and become the undisputed champ of the automation game.

Lastly, let's not forget the ""Moat Factor"" here. UiPath isn't just some one-trick pony. They've built a robust ecosystem of partners , developers, and integrations, making it a pain in the butt for competitors to catch up. It's like they've surrounded themselves with a fortress of innovation, leaving others in the dust. And you know what happens when a company has a moat? Couple all of that with the growing fever around everything AI and this ticker is a ticking time. you can thank me later after you score a 100x

&#x200B;

TL;DR: UiPath is the ultimate RPA champion, automating processes and boosting company productivity. With rapid revenue growth, Solid balance sheet, a expanding customer base, a solid moat, and the current AI fever UiPath has the potential to make us all tendie millionaires as we ride this rocket to the moon! 🚀🤖💰",1685456727.0,3,2023-05-30

35,Volume tickers in play,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.",1685448293.0,4,2023-05-30

Btw II

Based on the $200 million estimate of *The Little Mermaid*’s budget, the Disney movie needs to make at least $500 million at the box office in order to be a success. The general rule of thumb is for a movie to earn back at least 2.5 times its budget, so if *The Little Mermaid*’s box office comes in between $500-625 million, then Disney’s latest live-action remake will have been victorious. Still, the studio is most likely eyeing a number closer to $1 billion dollars at the box office before *The Little Mermaid* starts streaming on Disney Plus.

(then Cathie Woods sold Nvidia, presumably)

This is how the valuation looks:

Revenue = $11Bn

Operating income of $5.95Bn

(who the f\*\^% knows what the tax rate will be, but let's say...)

Net income of $5.1Bn or **EPS of $2.069 on a non-GAAP basis.**

Now, annualise this = \~$8.279

41,Weekly Expected Moves! Frothy Markets,"[https://i.postimg.cc/kG3YpBVS/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/kG3YpBVS/image.png)

 

Use these like any indicator, with caution. Basically gives you an understanding of when we start going into oversold or overbought territories.

1. This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers.
2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves. Obviously, if there are unexpected poison pills in an earnings report or if there are unexpected positive catalysts, you can move outside the deviations.
3. it's expected that 70% of the time we fall within the range by the end of the week/month/quarter. So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair it together with another tool called RSI. Most people are familiar with RSI. If we break out of the upper expected moves on already high RSI, this can create favorable short setups where you do have probabilities on your side. Now keep in mind point 1 & 2 that I made. You can have overbought + high RSI on individual tickers like MSFT and NVDA because of something that may fundamentally change the company like a new revenue stream. Hence why this is more useful on index-related products.
4. At the end of the day, this is all a game of probability. When you are oversold on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the upside. When you are overbought on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the downside.",1685416944.0,20,2023-05-30

So far in 2023, food has been the most effective indicator for predicting inflation, with healthcare also growing in significance.

**Are we nearing the 2% goal?**

There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. After reaching a peak of 11.4% in August 2022, the year-on-year increase in U.S. consumer food prices was 7.7% in April 2023. Although most retail food prices are still higher than they were a year ago, the overall trend appears to be moving in a consumer-friendly direction.

**What's causing the delay?**

Firstly, it takes time for lower commodity prices to be reflected in retail food prices. Secondly, while energy costs have decreased from their peak and some supply chain issues have been resolved, wages and other costs continue to rise.

**Where does this leave the Fed?**

The Fed finds itself in a tricky situation. Persistent economic strength and slow progress on bringing down inflation combine to make **a compelling case for additional rate hikes**. However, further tightening of monetary policy could pose **challenges for regional banks** and potentially **trigger larger shocks** for bigger players. It could also negatively impact other sectors of the economy.

Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), a leading chipmaker and AI company is on a tear recently, with its stock price hitting $389.46 on May 26, 2023 - a nearly 30% jump since the last earnings report. Contrastingly, the broader economic, geopolitical, and social environment send signals of uncertainty. The market's volatility index (VIX), which currently rests at a relatively low level of 17.95 hints at an imminent  downturn, indicating complacency among investors. However, it's important to remember that markets are complex and frequently behave contrary to expectations.

While the broader market seems calm, one sector, in particular, is leading the trend: the technology sector with chipmakers and AI companies are seeing a significant uptick.

**The big question is, should we dive in or wait it out?**

Before we get into that, let's be clear, this analysis is not financial advice. It's meant to shed some light that help us make better-informed decisions.

Let's get into it!

Nvidia's fundamentals are robust, but that's not our focus today. With the company venturing into high-growth territory and emotional responses overpowering rational data, we're turning our attention to technical analysis for potential insight into future movements.

To begin, we can see the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for NVDA is at 83.62, suggesting an overbought condition, which is typically considered when the RSI is above 70. This high RSI value might imply that the stock is due for a short-term pullback, as observed in NVDA's historical performance.

In the past, NVDA's RSI crossed the extreme overbought line of 80 five times: on Feb. 19, 2020, Sept. 2, 2020, July 6, 2021, and Nov. 8, 2021. Each time this occurred, there was a short-term pullback in the stock price ranging from 5.0% to 38.9% over periods from three sessions to a month. However, in each case, the stock reached a new record high within three months of the pullback.

Previously, a pattern referred to as bearish technical divergence was observed, which suggests that rallies are taking more and more out of the bulls, leaving them vulnerable to bear attacks. This pattern emerged in Nov. 2021 when the stock kept rising to a record $333.76 on Nov. 29, 2021, while the RSI was actually trending lower to a sub-overbought reading of 69.53 that day. This was followed by a significant 11-month bear market, where the price plunged 66.4% before bottoming at $112.27 on Oct. 14, 2022.

NVDA's price is currently close to the Fibonacci resistance level of $394.8. If it breaks this resistance, the next key level to watch would be $483.48. On the other hand, if the price declines, the Fibonacci levels of $364.09, $360.93, and $339.98 could provide support.

Fibonacci extension is another technical tool to identify possible resistance.The most common Fibonacci extension levels are 1.618, 2.618, and 4.236.

Let's calculate the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level for NVDA:

1. Subtract the low from the high to get the difference: 394.80 - 108.13 = 286.67
2. Multiply the difference by the Fibonacci ratio: 286.67 \* 1.618 = 464.02
3. Add the result to the low price: 108.13 + 464.02 = 572.15

However, please note that these levels are theoretical and while they can often serve as areas of support or resistance, they're not guaranteed to hold.

In summary, NVDA has been experiencing a strong upward trend across all these periods. This is accompanied by high trading volumes, suggesting robust investor interest. Given the strength of this upward trend and high trading volumes, it could be surmised that the market sentiment towards NVDA is bullish.

During the past 13 years, the highest PE Ratio of NVIDIA was 224.98. The lowest was 13.68. And the median was 39.94

&#x200B;

**So, where do we stand?**

Nvidia's underlying fundamentals are strong, yet the recent trading frenzy seems to eclipse these fundamental values. As emotions run high, we're observing price action that is increasingly detached from the stock's intrinsic worth. Anticipate considerable volatility in the coming month, which may lead to substantial capital losses for those choose to trade this stock even though overall sentiment is bullish. That being said, our enthusiasm for NVDA and AI at large is unwavering. We're extremely bullish, and we foresee plenty of upside potential. Despite this, due caution is warranted. Here are our projections and perspectives for the ensuing month:

&#x200B;

**Bear Scenario:**

While we've discussed the bull case for NVDA, it's equally important to consider the potential downside risks. If we look at the Fibonacci retracement levels, $364 emerges as the first potential support level that could hold during this breakout rally. Moreover, during a bull run, the 5-day moving average often provides a level of support while 10-day MA could signal possible weakness, so it's essential to keep an eye on this as well.

One notable aspect of NVDA's recent price action is the significant gap up. This has created a large area that could be 'filled' if the stock were to pull back, which is a common pattern in technical analysis. As such, we could see NVDA potentially retracing to the $320 level, which, given the gap-fill scenario, could serve as a very strong support level.

These are all potential scenarios that could play out in the near term. It's important to monitor these levels and adjust our investment strategies accordingly, always being mindful of both potential upside and downside risks.

&#x200B;

**Bull Scenario:**

On the more optimistic, or bullish, side of the spectrum, we draw upon Tesla's impressive P/E ratio of over 1,000 during its significant rally two years ago. If NVDA were to reach a similar P/E ratio, this would translate to a stock price of $2190. However, considering NVDA's near trillion-dollar market capitalization and current growth rates, reaching such a level would be extremely ambitious. At this stock price, NVDA would have a market cap of an astonishing $5 trillion.

For perspective, Apple, currently the world's most valuable company, has a market cap of $2.7 trillion. If NVDA were to reach the same market cap as Apple, this would equate to a stock price of $1095. However, the market often anticipates such significant milestones and investors may start selling before reaching this psychological barrier.

As NVDA begins to show signs of a meme stock momentum, it’s essential to draw upon historical precedents from similar market movements. Notably, Dogecoin experienced a sharp downturn after it nearly reached the much-anticipated $1 target, peaking at $0.74. AMC's stock price exhibited a similar pattern, retreating after it hit $72. There appears to be a consistent trend of investors taking profits when the price hits approximately 3/4 of a clear target. Given this, if we set a bullish target for NVDA at $1,000, we can anticipate a potential price ceiling in the vicinity of $720, where significant resistance may be encountered. For those seeking to mitigate risk, considering an exit at around $680 could be a prudent strategy. This price corresponds to a market capitalization of $1.68 trillion and a P/E ratio of 355.5. While this is an ambitious target, it's not beyond the realms of possibility given the current rally.

&#x200B;

**Realistic Scenario:**

Based on our analysis of Fibonacci Retracement levels and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio trends, we consider NVDA reaching $480 as the most probable outcome. This represents a potential 23% increase from the current price level. In this scenario, NVDA would have a P/E ratio of 251.31, indicating a market capitalization of approximately $1.18 trillion. This could be an opportune moment to sell, locking in gains before any potential market correction.

While it's also interesting to note that at a P/E ratio of 300, while high, is not unheard of for high-growth tech stocks. This would place NVDA's market cap at around $1.4 trillion and the stock price at approximately $573, which is in line with Fibonacci extension. Given NVDA's strong fundamentals and growth prospects, we believe this could be the upper bounds of realistic outcome.

In conclusion, while trading high volatility stocks with meme stock momentum can be very risky, and has no fundamental backing at this point. It comes down to emotional control and resilience. We believe that a thorough understanding of NVDA's technical and fundamental indicators can guide investment decisions. Please keep in mind that investing involves risk and it is important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

&#x200B;

It's crucial to remain cool-headed and resilient. Knowledge is power, so understand the technical and fundamental indicators to guide your investment decisions. Remember, trading involves risk - don't go all-in without doing your homework and consulting with a professional advisor. Happy trading!",1685370725.0,55,2023-05-29

CEO Jensen Huang shared these near-death stories at a commencement speech last night.

Here's what he said:

LESSON 1: Have the humility to confront failure and ask for help

Nvidia's first big 3D chip contract was for Sega's new game console. 

From Jensen:

""After one year of development, we realized our architecture was the wrong strategy...

I contacted the CEO of Sega and suggested that they should find another partner. But I also needed Sega to pay us in full or Nivida would be out of business. 

I was embarrassed to ask. The CEO of Sega, to his credit and to my amazement, agreed. His understanding and generosity gave us six months to survive.

Confronting our mistake, and with humility, asking for help, saved Nvidia. These traits are the hardest for the brightest and most successful.""

LESSON 2: Endure the pain and suffering needed to realize your dream

In 2007, Nvidia announced CUDA, a new computing model for GPUs. 

From Jensen:

""Creating a new computing model is incredibly hard...Nvidia's profits took a significant hit...

We suffered many years of poor performance. 

Our shareholders were skeptical of CUDA and preferred we focused on improving profitability. But we persevered...

This journey forged our character to endure the pain and suffering that is always needed to realize a vision.""

LESSON 3: Make sacrifices for your life's work

In 2010, Nvidia had the lead in the mobile chip market. But then the competition came in.

From Jensen:

""The phone market is huge; we could have chosen to fight for share. Instead, we made a hard decision and sacrificed the market...

Nvidia's mission is to build computers to solve problems that ordinary computers cannot. 

We should dedicate ourselves to realizing our vision...

Our strategic retreat paid off. By leaving the phone market, we opened our minds to invent a new one.

To retreat from a giant phone market to create a $0 billion market was a risky move, but it paid off. 

Retreat does not come easily to the brightest people, yet strategic retreat, sacrifice, and deciding what to give up is at the very core of success.""

//

Jensen wrapped up the speech with this:

""Run don't walk. Either you're running for food, or you are running from being food:

1. Have the humility to confront failure and ask for help.
2. Endure the pain needed to realize your dream.
3. Make sacrifices for your life's work.""

76,"Redfin (RDFN) primed for a huge recovery, lots of fear around it, which is our gain. Details here."," 

Hello Autists, 

Today I am presenting Redfin (RDFN) and why it can and will be a 200% play over the next two years. Yes, I did say 200%. Just on stock, not even counting options. Let's jump in. 

**Investment Thesis:** Redfin a super cyclical stock will be rebounding with great strength due to Online Real Estate Market Growth, AI investments, diverse Revenue Streams, and most importantly shrinking interest rate environment to kick it all off. They also got rid of their Buying program and implemented for the first time now the Redfin Premier Nationwide service to homebuyers. 

***What is Redfin?***

Redfin is a residential online real estate brokerage. The company uses technologies such as map search and virtual house showings to increase exposure, improve the quality of the customer experience, all while delivering efficiencies and saving the consumer costs. Redfin also provides the ability to do digital and online document management making it a one stop shop for one’s real estate needs. 

They also use the same combination of technology and local service to originate mortgage loans and offer title and settlement services. They also offer digital platforms to connect consumers with available apartments and houses for rent.

**Their mission is to redefine real estate in favor of the consumer. To change an industry that has had little disruption. Redfin's business model to undercut competition is based on sellers paying Redfin a discounted fee, either 1 or 1.5% to list the seller's home.**

Real Estate agents have to be the biggest thieves taking 6% commission being a realtor. Every $1,000,000 home sold equals $60,000 in fees for a license that can be earned in 75 classroom hours. And requires no technical skills or degree. Nothing against real estate agents, but after watching Selling Sunset on Netflix and working in real estate investments myself, I am ready to see the real estate market adapt, and move past agents who don’t provide more than $20 of value and headaches saying “Location, location, location” so I can buy more FD and OTD’s in my brokerage**.** 

**Investment Thesis Catalysts:** 

**Online Real Estate Market Growth and Market Share:** There is ongoing shift towards online platforms in the real estate industry that present an opportunity for Redfin to capture a larger share of the market. As more homebuyers and sellers embrace digital solutions, Redfin's technology-driven approach and user-friendly platform could lead to increased adoption and market penetration.

If any of you autists have ever used RDFN then you know first hand that there is a smooth process with limited conflict of interest since their agents are not commission based. People are becoming tired of the fees posed by traditional agents. Even though there has been a slow down in revenues across the real estate brokerage industry, going forward in a digital world I expect this to continue to grow. 

Redfin currently only has .78% of the entire market share in the US….there is room for growth for this billion dollar market cap company where they are actually not being thieves for 6%. 

The company's growth initiatives, such as geographic expansion and strategic partnerships, will contribute to its market dominance and attract more customers. **They just initiated Redfin Premier Nationwide.**

Redfin Premier is a specialized service that caters to high-end and luxury properties. It is designed to provide enhanced marketing and representation for luxury homes in select markets.Redfin Premier offers a range of features and services to sellers and buyers of luxury properties. These may include professional photography and video tours, custom marketing materials, targeted online advertising, and exposure on high-traffic websites and publications. And you know what they say…luxury products bring luxury margins. 

**Redfin also launched in 2022 their acquisition from 2021 RentPath**, because lets be honest owning a home for many people right now is a pipedream and now has a rental search. This creates a new pipeline of consumers in different phases of life and I don’t know how many of y’all have been apartment shopping recently but damn these rents just keep going up. While Redfin is known for home buying and selling services… apartment rentals is a new slice of the pie to grow into. And most of the time M&A is a waste of time but this I think added value to Redfin. 

**AI Investments:** I knew by putting AI in this, some of yall would make your keyboard sticky. They are making continued investments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analysis to make sure they provide personalized recommendations, improve user experience, and streamline the home buying and selling process to take consumer money and make us tendies. 

**Industry Trends:**

Real Estate transactions have gotten wrecked. Interest rates affect this industry a fuck ton. Redfin’s share price has plummeted since 2022. Interest rates and recessionary environments have made homebuyers less of a rush to close deals. 

Many experts in the mortgage industry see rates going down especially with the government preventing a US debt default. As the banking sector calms down. Economic data points towards a strong economy, and inflation eases, rates hopefully will go downward through the end of 2023. Fed tightening may put some upward pressure on mortgage rates in the near term, but ultimately more certainty about the Fed’s actions will help to smooth out some of the volatility we have seen with mortgage rates. It is likely that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates for the tenth consecutive time in May, which may represent the peak for the current round of policy tightening. Also if inflation surprises to the downside or recession fears intensify, mortgage rates could fall.

**Risks/The Dirty: Why this Stock has fallen 90% from its peak.** 

Real Estate market got fucked worse than an episode of Brazzers. Interest rates got hiked worse than Johnny Sins morning wood and a recession made people less likely to move. This combination wrecked REITs, brokerages, growth stocks, every autists portfolios, even those losers in r/dividends with their measly .69 cents quarterly payments. 

Risks include 

* Interest Rates
* Financial Health (They need to crank out some earnings, they are using preferred stock, stock based comp, and senior notes to get through rough times)
* Housing Market (Back to interest rates, houses need to be being bought.)

The good news is, I see that the stock has been wrecked by the risks above. And as the light at the end of tunnel gets closer the stock should derisk itself assuming real estate armageddon does not hit and the stock price should go up. I do not think it will get anywhere near the former all time high stock price in the next couple years, but think it will bring great gains that outpace the general market. 

**Future Outlook from Q1 2023 Earnings:**

* Reduced staff and made organizational changes, making support staff ratios to agents better
* Focused on mortgage cross selling business, concierge services, expanding Redfin Preimer Nationwide
* Exited the home buying business that again, fucked earnings like a scene out of brazzers. 
* Aim to return to the traditional broker model, increasing monetization.
* Projected real Estate Service back to growth in Q2 2023 and strong double digit growth in rental and mortgage businesses. 
* They expected adjusted EBITDA to be breakeven or better for 2023, $190 million better than 2022.

**Valuation Notes:**

The stock has been hammered…look at the stock chart. A lot of worst case nightmare scenarios came true for RDFN. Now RDFN is not a real estate company or REIT, it is a brokerage but also a tech stock. One of the biggest surprises when analyzing RDFN is their price to sales ratio. 

RDFN has a P/S ratio of .51 which is incredibly low and before covid traded anywhere from 1.25 to 1.8 regularly. Because the company is not currently profitable it is a great ratio to do a quick comp. Meanwhile stocks like PLTR have a 14.6x P/S ratio. I know they aren’t the same company or growth or macro factors. But as this stock continues to have a great 2023 and market cap grows, more and more institutional investors will enter this heavily cyclical stock that has the most to gain in a great economic cycle. 

As revenues rebound and grow, hopefully becoming profitable, see no reason this stock cannot hit over $30 in 30 months. 

**Conclusion:** 

Good stock. Fucked from tough times past 2 years. Innovative product that actually provides value at much more of a discount then some 6% sucking vampire real estate agent. Buy for tendies. I like it as interest rates go down, house buying environment picks back up, continued expansion, and better margins. Hopefully the worst is behind us and as earnings grow and the stock derisks, stock price will spike.

Look, I post here bc I hope that maybe what I post might help a few to understand and to protect their money. To prepare. Because when this unwinds, its going to be like something you have not ever seen.

I don't know when. Or what the trigger will be. But it will unwind.

With calls being extremely expensive right now, what are some good ways to take advantage of the ai wave?

some of you may say that ai is all hype or whatever-just given the assumption that we are in a massive ai bull run and stocks will continue to be pumped from earnings and announcements, what are the best strategies to take advantage?

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 

Eps was -$0.36 eoy last year , first q this year +$0.33 and only including two months of tingo foods for that quarter

They have 780.2 million cash on hand

 Earnings estimates of revenue , for q1 were 385million and they came in 851million

Analyst forecast of an eps end of 2023 are $1.83 with growth expectations to $4 eoy 2024

Forecast revenue eoy 2023 are at 4.6B and all earnings and estimates are on a fully diluted post merger restructuring of buisness 

Majority of this revenue came from 4 raw exports and a user base of 12 million farmers, however they ,through AFAN and kingdom of Ashanti have agreements to increase user base to 30-33 million farmers

Through launching strategic presence locations like Malawi they should expand their range of raw products like maize , cassava, sugar cane , cotton etc. More products=more $$

They are on schedule to finish a 1.6b processing plato export more processed goods such as coffees, teas, carbonated drinks etc which will allow them  will boost exports as well, and the solar supply is supported by Evtec Energy and their financial partners: Credit Suisse, JPMorgan, and Roth 

Also through AFAN and they will be expanding the warehouses for goods from 2000's to 80000 over next two years, to put in perspective Walmart has like 4k locations for you to understand the scope of this operation

Through their DMCC , dubai multi commodity centre, program it dollarizes and globalizes the buisness reducing risks of the local currency as well as boost export contracts and have access to those networks

Through PCX partnership and their commodity platform they will have priority placement for tingo dmcc to trade commodities as well

They have mentioned the board is also considering a structured dividend program /share backs and have already issued statements on warrant repurchases 

They are currently conducting an investigation on naked short selling of their stock and as a result any quanitive damages claim that that would be quite substantial

They just recently received an A1 credit rating from Datapro and have also undergone a rigorous audit from 4 of the top firms such as Deloitte and Ernst and Young amount others. Not to mention their founder Dozy has passed the EFL stringent review process of financials,

Dozy also has a side joint venture called omni tingo aviation, which if you own an airline it should reduce shipping costs if used for the company

They are also set to join the Russell 3000 index set to commence upon rebalancing June 23rd this year, which if funds follow this index it will be added amongst them

They also have a partnership with VISA , while only in beta version, for their tingo superpay app which will provide all types of financial benefits as well as the usage of visa global network. Full launch set for mid 2023

They are working on utilizing currently held relationships in China to work on expanding into new markets ,as well as other countries 

They are also working on dual listing their stock on multiple stock exchanges as well which will only add to more volume in trading

They currently hold rank 1 on Seeking Alphas top tech stocks Quant ratings system which picks stocks with the strongest collective value, growth, profitability, EPS Revisions, and price momentum metrics vs. the peer sector and has outperforms the S&P 500 12 years running

According to filings this past Friday and another bullish sign I noticed is where only reported short tute Blackstone didn't add to short position yet chose to cover 38% of it, and Vanguard adding close to 10% of position, bring their ownership of 5.3m shares, shows very bullish signs were getting closer

Most comparable companies trade at a forward multiple of 20-25 , such as PDD currently trading at $71, but even using conservative estimates,let's say 10 ,the forecast calls for an eps of 1.83 eoy which would put sp at $18 eoy , $40 end of 2024 given only the current revenue growth, and not including any impact from new market expansions or product offering increases.
Upper bullish case of a 25 multiple would be $45 and $100 respectively 

The sp currently is $3.42 so it is fair to say their is a severe price disconnect that should correct , given they stay on track.",1685302518.0,33,2023-05-28

This behind a paywall so I pasted some the text below:

By Ryan Dezember and Will Feuer

May 28, 2023 09:00 a.m. EDT

The green push by the U.S. and state gov­ern­ments is turn­ing trash into trea­sure and boost­ing the firms that han­dle Amer­i­ca’s garbage.

Shares of the big­gest play­ers in the U.S. trash busi­ness, Waste Man­age­ment and Re­pub­lic Ser­vices, have traded at record highs since Pres­i­dent Biden signed the cli­mate, tax and health­care bill in Au­gust. A re­cent de­cline not-withstanding, the stocks are pop­u­lar picks on Wall Street to ride the sus­tain­abil­ity boom higher.

“They’re sit­ting in this ex­traordinary po­si­tion,” said Michael Hoff­man, an an­a­lyst at in­vest­ment bank Stifel. “Garbage will be on the fore­front.” 

Ef­forts to re­duce green­house-gas emis­sions and to re­use ma­te­ri­als are mak­ing it more prof­itable to mine land­fills for en­ergy and sift through refuse for the hot com­modi­ties of the green econ­omy, such as de­ter­gent bot­tles and card­board boxes.

WM and Re­pub­lic are build­ing plants to iso­late meth­ane from the fumes emit­ted by rot­ting garbage and pipe it into the nat­ural-gas grid to be burned in power plants, fur­naces and kitchens. They are also equip­ping re­cy­cling fa­cil­i­ties with the lat­est in au­tomation to bet­ter sort and process ma­te­ri­als for the con­sumer-goods com­pa­nies that are un­der pres­sure to keep their pack­ag­ing out of land­fills and the ocean.

Land­fill own­ers are fore­cast­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars in ad­di­tional profit from ris­ing de­mand for re­cy­cled ma­te­ri­als and tax in­cen­tives for mak­ing en­ergy from emis­sions that would oth­er­wise seep into the at­mosphere.

“We’re blessed to be sit­ting right in the mid­dle of a mega­trend,” Re­pub­lic Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Jon Van­der Ark said. “We used to think about get­ting 5% top-line growth a year; now we’re in dou­ble-digit top-line growth mode.”",1685293039.0,40,2023-05-28

96,NVDA did not file a new shelf offering.,"No open positions in NVDA, but follow it. I’m seeing a misunderstanding run wild and thought I’d make a post to address it: NVIDIA on Friday did not file for NEW shelf offering. They filed an amendment to the one from February (the difference being dilution of 20 billion vs 10 billion). Further, the quarterly report explicitly addressed that this filing was coming purely for administrative purposes and that they actually have no plans to use it anytime soon (ie no dilution at all anytime soon).

The bear narrative that the rug has been pulled isn’t correct and everything can be understood by reading the quarterly report. 

TLDR Translation for WSB Bro: NVDA bear fucked. Can’t read good. Bear bad reading used to try to scare NVDA bull to give up money for Bear. But Bear fucked because other people read good.",1685285838.0,151,2023-05-28

98,SELLING STOCKS,"The relationship between various financial indicators, such as the DXY (U.S. Dollar Index), stock market, and treasury bonds, can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including the signing of the debt ceiling...

1. Strengthening of DXY and the Dollar: The U.S. Dollar is considered a safe-haven currency, meaning that during times of economic uncertainty or market volatility, investors often seek to hold their assets in USD. When the debt ceiling is signed, it signifies that the U.S. government has taken steps to address its debt obligations, which can restore confidence in the economy and the stability of the U.S. Dollar. As a result, demand for the Dollar may increase, leading to its appreciation relative to other currencies, as reflected in the DXY.

2. Decline in Stocks: The signing of the debt ceiling can sometimes create concerns about the potential impact on government spending and the overall economy. If investors perceive that the government's ability to meet its financial obligations is in question, it can lead to increased uncertainty and risk aversion in the stock market. Investors may sell off stocks and move their investments to safer assets, such as treasury bonds, causing stock prices to decline.

3. Rise in Treasury Bonds: Treasury bonds are considered relatively safe investments backed by the U.S. government. During periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility, investors often shift their funds from riskier assets, like stocks, to the perceived safety of treasury bonds. This increased demand for bonds can drive up their prices and lower their yields. Consequently, when the debt ceiling is signed, and there is a restoration of confidence in the government's financial stability, investors may flock to treasury bonds, leading to their appreciation.",1685284616.0,161,2023-05-28
99,SHORT $CRM ??,"Earnings expectations (next 12 months) have risen from $5.66 (in march) to $7.14 currently.  P/E is now over 30.  Could get a bump on Tuesday from debt ceiling.  It's already in pretty high overbought territory.

&#x200B;

Question:  If it pops over $220, do you think it's a good short?   

&#x200B;

I don't know the company that well, but doesn't seem too spectacular to me.  If it's overbought already, and we get a bounce going into earngins, and you believe a recession/liquidity drain is coming, might be something.  Thoughts?
